[//]: # Advice for writers:
[//]: # - Players prob won't know which tiles are which number, so make sure to also reference landmarks when possible
[//]: # - Try to speak concretely, even for hints. Don't say "maybe we can do this" because it's a bit redundant for a guide.
[//]: # - No spoiler text in the main area's description. Just add another foldout for accessing the area.
[//]: # - Write in the present tense.


[//]: # Here is a list of useful commands. Note that most of them only really apply if they are at the start of a line.

# General Advice


Slider is hard! Most of the people I watch often have to take breaks between playing because otherwise they get super fatigued and end up slogging through everything. If "Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and  expecting different results," then a lot of my friends must be insane when they play my game. When they come back, they often have a much better time  solving puzzles again.


In general, each area's hardest puzzles are the 3rd and 6th tile puzzles. (This is because you have enough tiles for interesting interactions to happen, and it is before you get too many tiles that moving the grid is annoying!) The difficulty curve of each area is intentionally not smooth because it makes puzzles and challenges a bit more memorable.
________________


# Village


Stonybrook Village is the first area in the game. It should help you get acquainted with how the world works and how the gameplay loop flows.


## Slider 2


The game starts with you in your house. You pick up your Artifact off the floor and head outside to find the world in disarray. As you explore, you should be able to eventually find the 2nd Slider.


Hint: ||Try moving the tile around and exploring everywhere. You can move on and off of your starting tile.||


Solution: ||While on the starting tile, move to the top-right of the grid. Above you is a small alcove area with a cow and the 2nd Slider.||


## Slider 3


Soon after collecting the second tile, you can start to interact with traveling between tiles and the off-map sections on the edges. The third slider should be easy to access on the second tile.


Solution: ||Talk to the Archeologist, the NPC on the slider near the ruins. If you keep talking to her she should give you the 3rd slider.||


## Slider 4


With 3 sliders on the map, this is where things get a bit tricky. It seems like there is no way to get onto the 3rd slider with the 'U' shaped walls, but that's where the next piece is.


Hint 1: ||Think outside the box!||


Hint 2: ||Do you remember where you picked up the second slider collectible? Or perhaps, an inconspicuous cow on the map?||


Solution: ||Get on the 1st slider with the house and move it to the top right. There, you can move to the off-map section of the world. After that, you should be able to move the 'U' shaped tile to the top right and get on it.||


## Slider 5


Now with 4 sliders, it should be easier to move around on the map. The 4th slider has Kevin asking you to rearrange and untangle his buoys. You can pick up and place them wherever you need.


Solution: ||You have to make sure none of the buoy lines are intersecting. It's probably easier if you move all of them to one side. You can pick a buoy to start with, and follow the line detangling them one by one.||


## Slider 6


The newest tile has another house -- and inside is an emotional support cat. How nice! Outside, Juliette is looking for her lover somewhere else on the map.


Solution: ||To reunite the lovers, move the tile with the man next to the tile with the woman so that they can see each other. This should be the 1st tile (with a house, the walls are an L shape), and the most recent 5th tile (with the other house, the walls are a reversed L shape).||


## Slider 7


Our newest tile has a lot on it. Pierre, the fisherman, is asking for fish. There's also a waterfall and some ruins too.


Hint 1: ||The fisherman is asking for fish, and the fish want to get to the waterfall in the top-left of the map. However, there aren't enough water tiles to bridge the gap. There's another way to progress forward.||


Hint 2: ||When you assemble part of the river (the waterfall tile 7 next to the straight river tile 2), some of the ruins on the top of the tile line up.||


Solution Part 1: ||You need to assemble the ruins in the corner of 4 different tiles. You can see them in the world as well as on the corners of the icons on the map. One is on the top-right of the waterfall tile 6, one on the top-left of the horizontal river tile 2, one on the bottom-left of your starting tile 1, and the last on the bottom-right of the 'U' shaped tile 3.||


Solution Part 2: ||Putting all 4 corners together should create a magical arrow which points you in a direction. If you follow the arrow to the tile it is pointing to (tile 5, below the house), there's a spot on the ground that should be glowing. You can interact with it to dig up the next slider.||


## Slider 8


At last, the final river piece!


Hint: ||Now that we have all 4 river sliders, we can finish the quest the fisherman by the waterfall and fish in the ocean had.||


Solution: ||Assemble the river from the waterfall in the top-left to the ocean in the middle right. The order should be waterfall in the top left (tile 6), horizontal river top middle (tile 2), corner top right with the buoys (tile 4), and finally the other corner you just got middle right (tile 7). Then, talking to the fish should populate the river and the fisherman by the waterfall will give you Slider 8.||


## Slider 9


With 8 sliders on the grid, moving things around is getting really tricky!


### Chad


Chad has taken a piece of the ruins, but he won't let us take it from him. The dastardly man has jumped onto a rock with it too! There has to be a way to bring him down...


Solution: ||If you give the tile a shake, Chad will lose his footing and fall off the rock. You should be able to pick up the piece of the ruins and turn it into the Archeologist on the horizontal river tile.||


### Part 2


After turning in the ruins piece to the Archeologist, she reads them out loud and the map shuffles! It's time to put everything back in its right place and solve the eight puzzle.


Hint: ||When solving 8 puzzles, it's a bit tricky because you might have a lot of pieces correct but still be far from the solution. When I solve them, I like to get one row or column correct, then mess around with the final 5 pieces until it works.||


Solution: ||Good luck :) `<a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Solve-Slide-Puzzles" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.wikihow.com/Solve-Slide-Puzzles</a>`||


## Area Complete!


Congratulations, you finished Stonybrook Village! Go claim your reward from the Mayor on the center tile (there's a map in his house). After that, head north to the top right and move onto the Chloro Caves.




________________


# Caves


Welcome to the Chloro Caves! What does Chloro mean? Well, I asked lead developer Boomo himself. According to him, Chloro stands for chlorophyll. This zone introduces fungi, a new type of obstacle that you'll have to navigate. Fungi, of course, do not possess chlorophyll.


## Slider 2


You start off with the first tile, having entered the caves from the south. If you're a crafty scoundrel, you may have found your way into the caves from a hidden entrance. On this tile, you'll find your first patch of fungi, and a Slider trapped within. But what other secrets do the caves hide?


Hint: ||There are many areas on the edges of the map you can access with just this first tile. Explore a bit.||


Solution: ||While on the starting tile, you can find the wrench in the bottom-left and the wire cutters in the top-left. Return them to the worker at the top-right of the grid, who will turn on the light and give you the second Slider.||


## Slider 3


Some light will give you an opportunity to explore how the fungi works. Even better, Slider 3 is easily found with a little exploration.


Solution: ||Use either of the lights to turn off the fungi. Then, you can pick up the third Slider.||


## Slider 4


My god, another light! The fungi surely stand no chance against your electrical might now…


Hint: ||Remember the Slider trapped in the fungi on tile 1?||


Solution: ||Place the first tile in the top-right corner, exposing it to light from the right. Place the third tile underneath the first tile, exposing it to light from the bottom. This should remove enough fungi for you to grab Slider 4 from the first tile.||


## Slider 5


On this tile is the cavern station. The power's gone out, and it's so dark that you can't even see the door!


Solution: ||Move the tile with the light underneath Slider 4. This will allow you to enter the station. Upon entering the station, you will need to complete a quick minigame on the console in order to unlock Slider 5.||


## Slider 6


Here you'll find another light, though the cable has been chewed up by rats. The archeologist makes her triumphant return, but she seems to have lost yet another item! What a klutz!


Solution Part 1: ||Pick up the Key collectible from Slider 5, and return it to the worker on the left inside the cavern station. This will allow you to switch on power, powering the light on Slider 5 if it is to the left of the cavern station. You can also see the power line on the map, which lights up yellow once powered.||


Solution Part 2: ||Find the tile with the flashlight (the second tile you got, with the river and large bridge), and place lights above and to the left. That should allow you to access the flashlight in the fungi patch. Return it to the archeologist and pick up Slider 6.||


## Slider 7


This tile is dominated by a massive field of fungi, with Slider 7 deep inside. You'll have to make full use of what you've learned so far to solve the puzzle, but it is possible!


Hint: ||This puzzle requires multiple moves, keep that in mind when setting up your grid.||


Solution: ||Place the power station light in the center of the grid, the other light tile in the top left, and Slider 6 in the top middle. Enter the fungi field, and stand in the row where there is no rock on the right side. Slide Slider 6 to the right, and then move the single light tile underneath Slider 6. You can then pick up Slider 7.||




## Slider 8


What's this? A rat has stolen Slider 8, and is now running away! Time for your best Tom and Jerry impression. 


Hint: ||The rat is faster, but you're smarter. Take advantage of the mechanics you've used so far, and your ability to move them.||


Solution: ||You can either corner the rat to catch it or chase it onto some removed fungi and then take away the light to regrow it. Either way, you now have Slider 8.||


## Slider 9


The archeologist has already made a great discovery on tile 8, but she can't quite read the runes. Light up the entire map!


Solution: ||There are multiple configurations that may work, note that tiles change color when they are fully lit. If you want some direction to work towards, the "correct" tile configuration is also a valid solution (the missing tile will be in the bottom-left). If you've completed the final puzzle in Stonybrook Village, this will be a breeze. When the caves are lit, a short cutscene will play, and then you'll receive Slider 9.||


## Area Complete!


Congratulations, you finished the Chloro Caves! On the final tile you'll find a gaggle of pirates, along with the archeologist and Chad. Pick up the boating license, because it's your ticket to the Shifting Seas. Head back to the Stonybrook Village pier, and get sailing!


________________


# Ocean


The Shifting Seas fills the role of being this game's water level. Instead of sliding tiles around, you rotate them. There's a lot to do and explore!


## Slider 2


Click on the arrows in the artifact in order to rotate tiles around.


Solution: ||Move onto the first tile and walk over to the X. If you interact with the X, an NPC should appear, thanking you and giving you the next piece.||


## Slider 3


With the tavern unlocked, you should be able to meet Bob and some tavern goers. Bob won't respect you without an anchor though :(. You should be able to win at a game of dice though.


Hint: ||You may have lost the initial roll, but you can still shake up the dice.||


Solution: ||If you move the tile, it will increment the number on the dice. Move the tavern tile a total of two times so that your total adds up to 11.||


## Slider 4


Finally, the Anchor! One of the most powerful artifacts in Slider, it allows you to pin down a tile.


Solution: ||In order to grab the anchor, you need to be in the water and move adjacent to it. Then you should be able to pick it up with 'e' and store it with 'q'. Once you have the anchor, return to Bob.||


## Slider 5


With the 4th slider unlocked, you can visit it and find the wizard Fezziwig. He's trying to cast a spell that moves tiles around, but he keeps falling off his rock.


Hint: ||You have a tool that can pin down movement.||


Solution: ||Place the anchor on the tile Fezziwig is on in order to stop him from moving. You can then pick up his Magical Gem reward and turn it into Bob to upgrade your Tavern Pass.||


## The Open Seas


After you turn in Fezziwig's reward, Bob gives you the rest of the tiles in the area. How generous! Thus, you set off on a journey to plunder the seas of all their treasure. Each item can be turned into Bob in order to upgrade your Tavern Pass. You can finish it when you turn in all of them. 


You can ask Bob for hints in the game as well.


### Shipwreck


The shipwreck is the easiest of all the new puzzles!


Solution: ||You need to assemble the two pieces of the shipwreck on the map. If you investigate the area around it, you'll find a glowing spot you can interact with to dig up a Treasure Chest.||


### Buoys


Kevin is back on one of the beaches and asks for your help to untangle his buoys again.


Solution: ||It can help if you move the three main island pieces to the top-right in their respective spots. Otherwise just keep trying to move the buoys to the correct spots.||


### Volcano


The Volcano puzzle requires you to place the volcano in the middle, and surround it with the other tiles with rocks.


Solution: ||After placing the tile in the middle, you can anchor it and rotate the other tiles until 3 of the rocks line up. You can tell they line up when the blue orb appears over them. For the last one, try anchoring one of the outer tiles instead of the volcano to finish adjusting.||


### The Foggy Seas


The Foggy Seas require you to travel the two foggy tiles in a specific order. You can get clues from several sources around the ocean.


Hint 1: ||The hints are given from Bob, the short child Ike in the tavern, and behind the tavern under the coconuts.||


Hint 2: ||The sequence is West, South, West, West, North, West.||


Solution: ||Start with both foggy tiles next to each other horizontally. Then, move from the right tile West, and it should light up one of the notes. Then, rotate the tiles so the other one is below yours, and move South onto it. The second note should be lit up. Continue this for West, West, North, West, and all 6 notes should light up.||


### Romeo and Juliette


Romeo and Juliette are seeking each other again. Romeo is on the top-left of the map trying to send a note to Juliette on the bottom-right, but it keeps sinking before it reaches her.


Hint 1: ||The bottle moves once whenever you move any tiles, and sinks after two moves. This means you have to get it to Juliette in two moves.||


Hint 2: ||The solution involves the Anchor.||


Solution: ||In order to move the bottle in two moves from the top-left to bottom-right, you need to make two diagonal moves. This can be done with the Anchor. If you put an anchor on the top-center or left-center tiles, you can rotate the tiles so that it makes a diagonal move. You can pick up the anchor and repeat the process to deliver the bottle with 2 diagonal moves.||


## Wrapping Up


After collecting all of the treasures from the seas, Bob asks you to put everything back to where it should be, one last time. You only need to place the three main island pieces in the top right (The one with the tavern, and the two beaches connected to it).


Then, Bob cuts down the trees blocking the way to the Jungle.


________________


# Jungle


Canopy Town features shape production and combination in a messy start up. You'll have to move Blobs so that they make and combine shapes to fulfill customers' orders.


## Slider 2 & 3


Welcome to the Jungle! To start off you have to learn how to use the huts, though they won't do much with only one.


Solution: ||Go upstairs using the ladder and talk to the person upstairs. He asks you to "Send some sticks up", which you can do by interacting with the signs on the Spawner until it has a stick symbol and an up arrow. Then, that guy tells you to go back down and report that the job has been completed.||


## Slider 4


It's time to start production. Barron asks you to give him a Stick and a Circle.


Solution: ||You can get a stick by sending a Stick into the hole. The Blobs will jump in the hole and you can pick their item up in the area downstairs, on the blanket by the big tree. To make a Circle, send two semi-circles to the same sign and they will combine.||


## Slider 5


Customers are asking for a Fish and a Boat. You'll have to find a configuration to combine the components to make them.


Fish Solution: ||(Images are not currently supported :( sorry)||


Boat Solution: ||(Images are not currently supported :( sorry)||


## Slider 6


It's time for a race. With Chad!


### Setting up the Race


There are a number of race cones representing the horizontal track between where Chad starts and the bell on the fat tile. The correct order should be tile 5 then 2/3. Before you can race though, Chad asks for a flag.


Flag Solution: ||(Images are not currently supported :( sorry)||


### Winning the Race


Now that the race is set up, you can start an attempt by talking to Chad while the race track is set up. But he's so fast! And if you break the track during the race, he stops it and calls you out for cheating.


Hint 1: ||Focus on the rules of the race -- what are the exact conditions for it starting or ending?||


Hint 2: ||You will have to use the Artifact to win.||


Solution: ||In order to beat Chad, you have to move faster than him. You can use the Artifact to move a tile, which moves faster than Chad. While you can't break the race track, you can move other tiles. To win, set up the race track and place a tile below your starting point. Start the race, hop onto the other tile, and move it all the way to the right. Then you can run up to the bell and ring it before Chad gets there.||


## Slider 7


Chad is defeated! You have picked up the Boots of Speed and the 6th tile with a duplicator on it. Now, we have three new orders for production as well: Crutches, a Bandage, and the Fish Bowl.


Crutches Hint: ||Some recipes require you to merge three shapes at once.||


Fish Bowl Hint 1: ||The Fish Bowl requires 5 components to make.||


Fish Bowl Hint 2: ||Try figuring out where the Duplicator tile has to be first, and build the rest of the tiles around it.||


Crutches Solution: ||(Images are not currently supported :( sorry)||


Bandage Solution: ||(Images are not currently supported :( sorry)||


Fish Bowl Solution: ||(Images are not currently supported :( sorry)||


## Slider 8


The hardest customers have arrived. It's time to make the Minecart and the Rails.


Hint 1: ||Think about how many components each Shape takes to make. The Minecart requires 6 total, and the Rails requires 7 total.||


Hint 2: ||Try figuring out where the Duplicator tile has to be first, and build the rest of the tiles around it.||


Minecart Solution: ||(Images are not currently supported :( sorry)||


Rails Solution: ||(Images are not currently supported :( sorry)||


## Slider 9


The area is... done? You pick up the 9th tile, but everything is still jumbled. The only way to fix this is to find another artifact: The Scroll of Realigning. Our journey continues in the Desert!




________________


# Desert


The Impact Zone is the fifth level which contains an important relic to finish the Jungle. Instead of moving one tile at a time, all the tiles slide in one direction!


## Slider 2


The river from the jungle leads up here! Try to get used to how tiles move, talk to the crocodile, and explore the edges of the map.


Hint: ||The camper in the top right of the map holds the next tile.||


Solution: ||On the first tile, cross the bridge and go down to find a log. Pick up the log and bring it to the campfire in the off-map section in the top right of the grid.||


## Slider 3 & 4


With the Oasis now on the map, try to connect it with the river piece so Crocodile can prepare.


Hint: ||Use the anchor to lock down one of the tiles!||


Solution: ||Walk onto either tile, lock it down with the anchor, then slide the other tile around so that the Oasis is on top of the river.||


## Slider 5 & 6


Time to bring Baboon and Jackal to the party! Go to the tile with three trees on it to see the Baboon or visit the Jackal on the tile with a giant fossil.


Baboon Hint 1: ||One of the trees on the right side of the Oasis has something tied at its neck. Tie the rope from Baboon’s tree to it.||


Baboon Hint 2: ||When testing the rope, keep Baboon’s tile and the Oasis next to each other.||


Baboon Hint 3: ||Use the anchor to set up the horizontal and vertical slide respectively, or have all four tiles in a 2x2 square. If you have five tiles, have the fifth tile be in the same row as the Oasis and Baboon tiles||


Baboon Hint 4: ||Shake the Baboon off the rope by separating the Oasis and Baboon’s original tile with the anchor.||


Jackal Hint 1: ||Jackal’s new bone is located on the top left of the map.||


Jackal Hint 2: ||Give Jackal enough momentum by sliding Jackal’s tile left towards the bone.||


Jackal Solution: ||Talk to Jackal and progress his dialogue. Bring Jackal to the top left of the map. Once Jackal is on the left border of the giant fossil tile, isolate the top row of the map using the anchor, then slide right two tiles and left two tiles. Bring the Oasis to the top left after so Jackal can join the party.||


## Slider 7


You’ll be able to find Gazelle and Chad in the Casino, but Gazelle’s in the VIP only section. To get in, you’ll need sunglasses! For now, Go into the casino and find Chad. Put the casino together, bring the dice over to Chad, and beat him at elevens!


Hint 1: ||Moving a Casino tile adds one to the dice on its respective half. Try to keep the Casino together.||


Hint 2: ||When the Anchor is placed on a Casino tile, it sets the die on that tile to 1.||


Hint 3: ||The easiest way to roll an 11 is to start with the two casino tiles next to each other. Set one of them to '2' and then use the anchor to set the other to a '1'. After that, move both tiles until they combine to an 11. Then, despair for Chad!||


## Slider 8


It's time for some mirages!


### Scroll Fragment
Talk to the VIP near the cactus at the bottom right of the tile with the tail of the giant fossil. Seems like if you can open the safe nearby, he’ll give you his sunglasses.


Hint 1: ||When you make a move, the two empty tiles will become a mirage! They show the past version of the two tiles that were originally in that spot.||


Hint 2: ||Standing on a mirage tile and sliding will teleport you back to the present version of the tile in the same location.||


Solution: ||Talk to the VIP on the tile with the tail of the giant fossil. Drink the cactus juice. Slide the left side of the casino to activate its mirage. Walk behind the counter on the Casino mirage tile, and slide anywhere to teleport to behind the counter on the normal casino. Grab the Scroll Fragment on the present version of the Casino Tile.||


### Melting the Safe


Time to crack open the safe! Seems like there’s still some power left in the dinosaur fossil. Go talk to the wizard on the mirage of the head of the fossil.


Hint 1: ||The Scroll Fragment moves the tile in the center to the highlighted empty tile.||


Hint 2: ||To activate the dino laser, connect the mirage head of the fossil to the tail (present or mirage) then talk to the wizard! First line up the fossil, then move both tiles or just the head tile.||


Hint 3: ||Use the Scroll Fragment to "duplicate" the tail tile so that the dino laser can hit the safe on the tail tile.||


Solution Part 1: ||To turn on the laser, line up the tail and head fossils on the bottom row with two empty spaces on the top row, slide up. Move onto the mirage head tile and talk to the wizard.||


Solution Part 2: ||Next, line the fossils up again with the tail in the center and the head to the right. Make sure there's an empty space in the top-right corner. Use the scroll fragment to move it there so that the laser shoots the safe. Get your reward and to the VIP.||


### Party Time!


Now with the shades, talk to Gazelle in the VIP section of the casino and see if you can bring him to the surprise party.


Solution: ||Bring the Oasis either to the left or below the right half of the Casino.||


## Slider 9


Seems like the Archeologist is looking at a glowing tablet near some ruins. Reading the ruins shuffles everything! Why am I getting a sense of deja vu?


Hint: ||Just like the village, try solving one row completely first, and then put the remaining five tiles together. For the most part, this 8 puzzle can be completely solved using just slides, the Scroll Fragment, and the occasional anchor. Don’t be afraid to temporarily move one tile out of place so you can fix the order using the Scroll Fragment! (Diagonal moves are super powerful!)||


## Scroll of Realigning


Head into the temple, move aside some rubble, and pick up the Scroll of Realigning. Though there’s no prize without a trap…


Hint: ||The room with the Scroll of Realigning is at the bottom of the temple. You may need to pick up some rocks to get there.||


Solution: ||Move the rocks by picking them up and walk to the bottom chamber in the map. After the trap activates, click the new shiny tab in the artifact that shows up in place of the Scroll button! Boom, auto solved!||


## Area Complete!


Now with the Scroll of Realigning, head back down to fix the Jungle, and then eastward towards the Factory!


With the Scroll of Realigning, you also unlock two extra powers. You can now Save & Load grids by clicking the => (Save) button and the <= (Load) button. This can be helpful if you want to save a puzzle setup before doing some execution with moving parts.
________________


# Factory


The Rocket Factory is probably Slider's hardest area. It formally introduces power, wires, conveyors, and timed gates. It is also super puzzle dense.


## How do Timed Gates Work?


This section is here to spell out how timed gates work, in case you have any confusion about them! Part of the fun is figuring them out and finding the edge cases you can exploit, but it's also spelled out here in case it gets frustrating.


The goal of the timed gates is to power all of its inputs within a certain number of moves. You can see the inputs that you need to power as batteries near the gate, or also the LED indicators on the actual gate itself. If you can power all of them, then the gate will stay on forever.


The large number on the gate represents how many tile moves you have left. If the gate has a 2 on it, then you only have two tile moves to power the entire gate. Conveyors do not count towards this limit!


The moves are only counted once they <i>completely</i> finish though. This means that you can chain together conveyor belt moves in order to squeeze more out of the very last moves.


## Slider 1


You can enter the Factory from the Jungle once you fix the minecart rail line and prove you have the Scroll of Realigning from the Desert. Once inside, you can talk to some NPCs and are introduced to the Timed Gate mechanic.


The first slider is in a closet above the starting area.


Solution: ||You'll have to activate the timed gate with the broken screen and power all three buttons connected to it. This should open the door and let you pick up the 1st Slider.||


## Slider 2


We finally have a slider on the map! We still have to get onto it and explore a bit before we find more Sliders though.


Timed Gate: ||To leave the starting area, you'll have to activate the timed gate below the door. This has a button for one of the power sources you can stand on, and the other is a wire which connects to our new tile. Moving the tile may reset the timed gate since it only allows two tile moves.||


Hint: ||You can use your anchor to hold the button down while you explore areas the door unlocks for you.||


Solution: ||Once you are in the top-right part of the map, hitting the switch will open the door (and turn on the conveyor, stranding you). You can then move the conductive bob inside back and forth to get through to the other Slider.||


## Slider 3


Our second slider has some giant magnets on it, which correspond to the giant magnets on the bottom-left of the map. That's where the 3rd slider is as well.


Hint: ||When powering the magnets, the conveyor won't move the tile.||


Solution: ||Stand on the button and move the tile to the bottom left. Then, while on the edge of the button, place the anchor down so the button stays powered even when you leave. You should be able to safely walk down and pick up the 3rd tile.||


## Slider 4


With 3 tiles, more timed gates means things get a bit more trickier. Three timed gates tricker in fact. 


Easy Timed Gate: ||Start on the tile with the timed gate on the right wall. Line up the other two so that they are above each other vertically. Then, you should be able to turn on the timed gate, and stand on the button to power the wire. You should be able to move to the other tile and slide the timed gate so that both get powered.||


Hard Timed Gate Hint 1: ||Some conveyors can be turned on and off.||


Hard Timed Gate Hint 2: ||Conveyor moves don't count towards the timed gates.||


Hard Timed Gate Hint 3: ||Conveyors can move anchored tiles.||


Solution: ||Start with the top-right conveyor turned off. Set up the tiles so that the one with the door on the right is on the center-right. Then, put the first tile with the door on top in the top-right, and the tile with magnets in the top-center.||


Solution Continued: ||Turn on the bathroom timed gate. Place your anchor on the top-right tile and turn on the conveyor to move it down. The timed gate should have one of the lines powered without using any moves. You can then walk onto the other tiles button and move it onto the conveyor. This will power the second line before the move finishes.||


## Slider 5


With the 4th tile, you are asked to gather several parts in order to 3D print the next Slider. They can be found in 3 different locations around the factory. After you get all 3 pieces you can use the 3D printer and it will make the next slider for you.


Locations: ||The Base is on the same tile as the printer, the walls are in the top-left of the Factory, and the wires are in the bottom-right of the Factory.||


Hint: ||One of the parts requires you to get a second item. You have the anchor already, but you need to somehow free the Conductive Bob from the gated area in the top-right of the map so that you can use it.||


Base Solution: ||In order to access the base, you need to power both lines to open both doors. To do this, you need two items, like the above hint mentions. You can free the Conductive Bob by using the anchor to conduct the two pylons through the holes in the gate. You should be able to then walk in and pick up the bob, and then leave. After that, you can use the anchor and the bob to open both doors.||


Walls Solution: ||The walls are behind the giant door in the top-left of the factory. You can power the timed gate near it using the tile with the printer.||


Wires Solution: ||The wires are in the bottom-right of the Factory. Normally, the conveyor in the way will move tiles so you can't get there. However, if you jam three tiles in the bottom row of the grid, then the conveyor won't be able to push it and you can walk to the bottom of the Factory.||


## Slider 6


The puzzle to get the 6th tile is a continuation of the Military game from the caves. Make sure to power the computers and then finish all the puzzles to win. 


Solution: ||Actually this puzzle hasn't been implemented yet.||


## Slider 7


Now, it's time to power the Mega Crystal! But, it needs 6 inputs? And it uses a 0 gate?!


Hint 1: ||If you try and set it up so that all the inputs are powered at the same time, you'll quickly notice that you need some tiles to be in multiple positions at the same time. Which isn't possible!||


Hint 2: ||Timed Gates will stay active as long as a tile is moving.||


Solution 1: ||In order to solve the puzzle, you need to set up a loop of conveyors so that they're always moving. That way, each of the inputs can be powered as the loop moves tiles around the Mega Crystal. First, use the conveyor override to make sure the conveyor belts aren't active. Then power all of the conveyor belts around the factory. Finally, before you re-enable them, make sure that the server room is powered so that the top two inputs can be powered during the loop. Turn on the conveyor loop and watch as everything gets powered!||


Solution 2: ||After the Crystal is powered, it should overload and cause a black out. You'll then have to use the crystal tile to power the server room and talk to Gene to run the server script. This will reset everything but also send you to the past.||


## Slider 8


We've been transported to the past! Take some time to explore, this should be an easier section.


Solution: ||Gather some buoys and explode the rock in the top-right in order to get access to Slider 8.||


## Slider 9


Fezziwig the wizard is here to help us get back to the future.


## Area Complete!


Congratulations, you finished the hardest area! After the Factory, the Foreman will task you with helping the Military south as well as fixing the Mountain area. You can do them in either order!




________________


# Military


The Military region has you fighting, commanding your Robot army to defeat the apathetic Aliens. You get as many tries as you want to win this rock-paper-scissors area.


This area features a lot of randomness, so there is no explicit solution. However, we can try to give some tips.


- Try to win as often as you can (or tie if you can't). The first few waves of aliens will always go the same, but then it's up to you to maximize your potential.


- You don't have to use the supply reinforcements right away. Oftentimes it can be worth it to consider waiting until a better moment to create the troop.


- There are six waves total, with an increasing number of enemies. Additionally you will get a reinforcement roughly for every other Slider you pick up.

# Mountain


!! This area of the guide is not finished !!


The Crystal Mines is the eighth area and one of the most challenging in the game. This area contains a 3D grid, ice, lava, crystals, and a massive network of minecart tracks to navigate. 


## Accessing the Mountain


Accessing the mountain is less straightforward than other areas. Per the directions of the Factory's Foreman, you can follow the rail line from the factory to the Chloro Caves. Unfortunately, that entrance is blocked, and you'll have to find another way in.


Hint: ||That massive door in the caves has a split power line attached to it.||


Solution: ||Use the anchor to bridge the gap in the wire on the top-left tile in the caves. This will open the large door, granting access to the Crystal Mines.||

On tile 2 you’ll find a basement, but the door is blocked by a crate and is locked. You’ll need to find a way to break the crate and obtain the key.


Hint 1: ||What large, heavy, metal object do you have that’s perfect for smashing stuff? Now that you’re in 3D, take head of gravity.||


Hint 2: ||The worker on tile 1 has the key, but he needs some lava in the bucket to warm up. Is there a lava source we might be able to||


## Slider 4


Tile 3 contains a massive waterwheel, used to generate power. Unfortunately, the gears have frozen over.


Hint 1: ||How have you gotten rid of ice before? You’ll need a different method for each gear.||


Solution Part 1: ||On the top level, put the waterwheel tile (tile 3) in the bottom left and the basement tile (tile 2) above it. The lava will melt the top gear. Place tile 1 underneath tile 3, then use the anchor to break the ice on the bottom gear.||


Solution Part 2: ||Bert the craftsman in the bottom left corner of the lower level will give you a toolbox free of charge. Bring it back to the waterwheel worker to fix the gears.||
