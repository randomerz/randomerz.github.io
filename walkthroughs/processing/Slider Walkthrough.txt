[//]: # Advice for writers:
[//]: # - Players prob won't know which tiles are which number, so make sure to also reference landmarks when possible
[//]: # - Try to speak concretely, even for hints. Don't say "maybe we can do this" because it's a bit redundant for a guide.
[//]: # - No spoiler text in the main area's description. Just add another foldout for accessing the area.
[//]: # - Write in present tense.


[//]: # Here is a list of useful commands. Note that most of them only really apply if they are at the start of a line.


[//]: # Section Title: # Village
[//]: # Subsection Title: ## Slider 1
[//]: # Subdivision: ### Building the Fish Bowl
[//]: # End Foldout: ### [END]
[//]: # End Foldout Cont: In general the foldouts will continue until the next one is created. If you want to end the current level of foldout, then do the appropriate number of #s and [END]

# General Advice


Slider is hard! Most of the people I watch often have to take breaks between playing because otherwise they get super fatigued and end up slogging through everything. If "Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and  expecting different results," then a lot of my friends must be insane when they play my game. When they come back, they often have a much better time  solving puzzles again.


In general, each area's hardest puzzles are the 3rd and 6th tile puzzles. (This is because you have enough tiles for interesting interactions to happen, and it is before you get too many tiles that moving the grid is annoying!) The difficulty curve of each area is intentionally not smooth because it makes puzzles and challenges a bit more memorable.
________________


# Village


Stonybrook Village is the first area in the game. It should help you get acquainted with how the world works and how the gameplay loop flows.


## Slider 2


The game starts with you in your house. You pick up your Artifact off the floor and head outside to find the world in disarray. As you explore, you should be able to eventually find the 2nd Slider.


Hint: ||Try moving the tile around and exploring everywhere. You can move on and off of your starting tile.||


Solution: ||While on the starting tile, move to the top-right of the grid. Above you is a small alcove area with a cow and the 2nd Slider.||


## Slider 3


Soon after collecting the second tile, you can start to interact with traveling between tiles and the off-map sections on the edges. The third slider should be easy to access on the second tile.


Solution: ||Talk to the Archeologist, the NPC on the slider near the ruins. If you keep talking to her she should give you the 3rd slider.||


## Slider 4


With 3 sliders on the map, this is where things get a bit tricky. It seems like there is no way to get onto the 3rd slider with the ‘U' shaped walls, but that's where the next piece is.


Hint 1: ||Think outside the box!||


Hint 2: ||Do you remember where you picked up the second slider collectible? Or perhaps, an inconspicuous cow on the map?||


Solution: ||Get on the 1st slider with the house and move it to the top right. There, you can move to the off-map section of the world. After that, you should be able to move the ‘U' shaped tile to the top right and get on it.||


## Slider 5


Now with 4 sliders, it should be easier to move around on the map. The 4th slider has Kevin asking you to rearrange and untangle his buoys. You can pick up and place them wherever you need.


Solution: ||You have to make sure none of the buoy lines are intersecting. It's probably easier if you move all of them to one side. You can pick a buoy to start with, and follow the line detangling them one by one.||


## Slider 6


The newest tile has another house -- and inside is an emotional support cat. How nice! Outside, Juliette is looking for her lover somewhere else on the map.


Solution: ||To reunite the lovers, move the tile with the man next to the tile with the woman so that they can see each other. This should be the 1st tile (with a house, the walls are an L shape), and the most recent 5th tile (with the other house, the walls are a reversed L shape).||


## Slider 7


Our newest tile has a lot on it. Pierre, the fisherman, is asking for fish. There's also a waterfall and some ruins too.


Hint 1: ||The fisherman is asking for fish, and the fish want to get to the waterfall in the top-left of the map. However, there aren't enough water tiles to bridge the gap. There's another way to progress forward.||


Hint 2: ||When you assemble part of the river (the waterfall tile 7 next to the straight river tile 2), some of the ruins on the top of the tile line up.||


Solution Part 1: ||You need to assemble the ruins in the corner of 4 different tiles. You can see them in the world as well as on the corners of the icons on the map. One is on the top-right of the waterfall tile 6, one on the top-left of the horizontal river tile 2, one on the bottom-left of your starting tile 1, and the last on the bottom-right of the ‘U' shaped tile 3.||


Solution Part 2: ||Putting all 4 corners together should create a magical arrow which points you in a direction. If you follow the arrow to the tile it is pointing to (tile 5, below the house), there's a spot on the ground that should be glowing. You can interact with it to dig up the next slider.||


## Slider 8


At last, the final river piece!


Hint: ||Now that we have all 4 river sliders, we can finish the quest the fisherman by the waterfall and fish in the ocean had.||


Solution: ||Assemble the river from the waterfall in the top-left to the ocean in the middle right. The order should be waterfall in the top left (tile 6), horizontal river top middle (tile 2), corner top right with the buoys (tile 4), and finally the other corner you just got middle right (tile 7). Then, talking to the fish should populate the river and the fisherman by the waterfall will give you Slider 8.||


## Slider 9


With 8 sliders on the grid, moving things around is getting really tricky!


### Chad


Chad has taken a piece of the ruins, but he won't let us take it from him. The dastardly man has jumped onto a rock with it too! There has to be a way to bring him down...


Solution: ||If you give the tile a shake, Chad will lose his footing and fall off the rock. You should be able to pick up the piece of the ruins and turn it into the Archeologist on the horizontal river tile.||


### Part 2


After turning in the ruins piece to the Archeologist, she reads them out loud and the map shuffles! It's time to put everything back in its right place and solve the eight puzzle.


Hint: ||When solving 8 puzzles, it's a bit tricky because you might have a lot of pieces correct but still be far from the solution. When I solve them, I like to get one row or column correct, then mess around with the final 5 pieces until it works.||


Solution: ||Good luck :) `<a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Solve-Slide-Puzzles" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.wikihow.com/Solve-Slide-Puzzles</a>`||


## Area Complete!


Congratulations, you finished Stonybrook Village! Go claim your reward from the Mayor on the center tile (there's a map in his house). After that, head north to the top right and move onto the Chloro Caves.

# Caves


Not done.

# Ocean


The Shifting Seas fills the role of being this game's water level. Instead of sliding tiles around, you rotate them. There's a lot to do and explore!


## Slider 2


Click on the arrows in the artifact in order to rotate tiles around.


Solution: ||Move onto the first tile and walk over to the X. If you interact with the X, an NPC should appear, thanking you and giving you the next piece.||


## Slider 3


With the tavern unlocked, you should be able to meet Bob and some tavern goers. Bob won't respect you without an anchor though :(. You should be able to win at a game of dice though.


Hint: ||You may have lost the initial roll, but you can still shake up the dice.||


Solution: ||If you move the tile, it will increment the number on the dice. Move the tavern tile a total of two times so that your total adds up to 11.||


## Slider 4


Finally, the Anchor! One of the most powerful artifacts in Slider, it allows you to pin down a tile.


Solution: ||In order to grab the anchor, you need to be in the water and move adjacent to it. Then you should be able to pick it up with 'e' and store it with 'q'. Once you have the anchor, return to Bob.||


## Slider 5


With the 4th slider unlocked, you can visit it and find the wizard Fezziwig. He's trying to cast a spell that moves tiles around, but he keeps falling off his rock.


Hint: ||You have a tool that can pin down movement.||


Solution: ||Place the anchor on the tile Fezziwig is on in order to stop him from moving. You can then pick up his Magical Gem reward and turn it into Bob to upgrade your Tavern Pass.||


## The Open Seas


After you turn in Fezziwig's reward, Bob gives you the rest of the tiles in the area. How generous! Thus, you set off on a journey to plunder the seas of all their treasure. Each item can be turned into Bob in order to upgrade your Tavern Pass. You can finish it when you turn in all of them. 


You can ask Bob for hints in the game as well.


### Shipwreck


The shipwreck is the easiest of all the new puzzles!


Solution: ||You need to assemble the two pieces of the shipwreck on the map. If you investigate the area around it, you'll find a glowing spot you can interact with to dig up a Treasure Chest.||


### Buoys


Kevin is back on one of the beaches and asks for your help to untangle his buoys again.


Solution: ||It can help if you move the three main island pieces to the top-right in their respective spots. Otherwise just keep trying to move the buoys to the correct spots.||


### Volcano


The Volcano puzzle requires you to place the volcano in the middle, and surround it with the other tiles with rocks.


Solution: ||After placing the tile in the middle, you can anchor it and rotate the other tiles until 3 of the rocks line up. You can tell they line up when the blue orb appears over them. For the last one, try anchoring one of the outer tiles instead of the volcano to finish adjusting.||


### The Foggy Seas


The Foggy Seas require you to travel the two foggy tiles in a specific order. You can get clues from several sources around the ocean.


Hint 1: ||The hints are given from Bob, the short child Ike in the tavern, and behind the tavern under the coconuts.||


Hint 2: ||The sequence is West, South, West, West, North, West.||


Solution: ||Start with both foggy tiles next to each other horizontally. Then, move from the right tile West, and it should light up one of the notes. Then, rotate the tiles so the other one is below yours, and move South onto it. The second note should be lit up. Continue this for West, West, North, West, and all 6 notes should light up.||


### Romeo and Juliette


Romeo and Juliette are seeking each other again. Romeo is on the top-left of the map trying to send a note to Juliette on the bottom-right, but it keeps sinking before it reaches her.


Hint 1: ||The bottle moves once whenever you move any tiles, and sinks after two moves. This means you have to get it to Juliette in two moves.||


Hint 2: ||The solution involves the Anchor.||


Solution: ||In order to move the bottle in two moves from the top-left to bottom-right, you need to make two diagonal moves. This can be done with the Anchor. If you put an anchor on the top-center or left-center tiles, you can rotate the tiles so that it makes a diagonal move. You can pick up the anchor and repeat the process to deliver the bottle with 2 diagonal moves.||


## Wrapping Up


After collecting all of the treasures from the seas, Bob asks you to put everything back to where it should be, one last time. You only need to place the three main island pieces in the top right, as well as the other shipwreck piece in the top left.


Then, Bob cuts down the trees blocking the way to the Jungle.

# Jungle


Canopy Town features shape production and combination in a messy start up. You'll have to move Blobs so that they make and combine shapes to fulfill customers' orders.


## Slider 2 & 3


Welcome to the Jungle! To start off you have to learn how to use the huts, though they won't do much with only one.


Solution: ||Go upstairs using the ladder and talk to the person upstairs. He asks you to "Send some sticks up", which you can do by interacting with the signs on the Spawner until it has a stick symbol and an up arrow. Then, that guy tells you to go back down and report that the job has been completed.||


## Slider 4


It's time to start production. Barron asks you to give him a Stick and a Circle.


Solution: ||You can get a stick by sending a Stick into the hole. The Blobs will jump in the hole and you can pick their item up in the area downstairs, on the blanket by the big tree. To make a Circle, send two semi-circles to the same sign and they will combine.||


## Slider 5


Customers are asking for a Fish and a Boat. You'll have to find a configuration to combine the components to make them.


Fish Solution: ||(Images are not currently supported :( sorry)||


Boat Solution: ||(Images are not currently supported :( sorry)||


## Slider 6


It's time for a race. With Chad!


### Setting up the Race


There are a number of race cones representing the horizontal track between where Chad starts and the bell on the fat tile. The correct order should be tile 5 then 2/3. Before you can race though, Chad asks for a flag.


Flag Solution: ||(Images are not currently supported :( sorry)||


### Winning the Race


Now that the race is set up, you can start an attempt by talking to Chad while the race track is set up. But he's so fast! And if you break the track during the race, he stops it and calls you out for cheating.


Hint 1: ||Focus on the rules of the race -- what are the exact conditions for it starting or ending?||


Hint 2: ||You will have to use the Artifact to win.||


Solution: ||In order to beat Chad, you have to move faster than him. You can use the Artifact to move a tile, which moves faster than Chad. While you can't break the race track, you can move other tiles. To win, set up the race track and place a tile below your starting point. Start the race, hop onto the other tile, and move it all the way to the right. Then you can run up to the bell and ring it before Chad gets there.||


## Slider 7


Chad is defeated! You have picked up the Boots of Speed and the 6th tile with a duplicator on it. Now, we have three new orders for production as well: Crutches, a Bandage, and the Fish Bowl.


Crutches Hint: ||Some recipes require you to merge three shapes at once.||


Fish Bowl Hint 1: ||The Fish Bowl requires 5 components to make.||


Fish Bowl Hint 2: ||Try figuring out where the Duplicator tile has to be first, and build the rest of the tiles around it.||


Crutches Solution: ||(Images are not currently supported :( sorry)||


Bandage Solution: ||(Images are not currently supported :( sorry)||


Fish Bowl Solution: ||(Images are not currently supported :( sorry)||


## Slider 8


The hardest customers have arrived. It's time to make the Minecart and the Rails.


Hint 1: ||Think about how many components each Shape takes to make. The Minecart requires 6 total, and the Rails requires 7 total.||


Hint 2: ||Try figuring out where the Duplicator tile has to be first, and build the rest of the tiles around it.||


Minecart Solution: ||(Images are not currently supported :( sorry)||


Rails Solution: ||(Images are not currently supported :( sorry)||


## Slider 9


The area is... done? You pick up the 9th tile, but everything is still jumbled. The only way to fix this is to find another artifact: The Scroll of Realigning. Our journey continues in the Desert!

# Mountain


The Crystal Mines is the eighth area and one of the most challenging in the game. This area contains a 3D grid, ice, lava, crystals, and a massive network of minecart tracks to navigate. 


## Accessing the Mountain


Accessing the mountain is less straightforward than other areas. Per the directions of the Factory's Foreman, you can follow the rail line from the factory to the Chloro Caves. Unfortunately, that entrance is blocked, and you'll have to find another way in.


Hint: ||That massive door in the caves has a split power line attached to it.||


Solution: ||Use the anchor to bridge the gap in the wire on the top-left tile in the caves. This will open the large door, granting access to the Crystal Mines.||

Mountain Climber


## Slider 3


On tile 2 you’ll find a basement, but the door is blocked by a crate and is locked. You’ll need to find a way to break the crate and obtain the key.


Hint 1: ||What large, heavy, metal object do you have that’s perfect for smashing stuff? Now that you’re in 3D, take head of gravity.||


Hint 2: ||The worker on tile 1 has the key, but he needs some lava in the bucket to warm up. Is there a lava source we might be able to||


## Slider 4


Tile 3 contains a massive waterwheel, used to generate power. Unfortunately, the gears have frozen over.


Hint 1: ||How have you gotten rid of ice before? You’ll need a different method for each gear.||


Solution Part 1: ||On the top level, put the waterwheel tile (tile 3) in the bottom left and the basement tile (tile 2) above it. The lava will melt the top gear. Place tile 1 underneath tile 3, then use the anchor to break the ice on the bottom gear.||


Solution Part 2: ||Bert the craftsman in the bottom left corner of the lower level will give you a toolbox free of charge. Bring it back to the waterwheel worker to fix the gears.||


## Slider 5


### Obtaining the Minecart

Solution: ||Move tile 4, the one with the big ice patch, to the bottom right corner on the lower level. Talk to the NPC near the powered rails to activate the explosives, blowing up the wall and giving you the minecart||
