                <h2>Slider Walkthrough</h2>

<p>
	This is the walkthrough guide for <a href="../games/slider.html">Slider</a>. It includes hints and solutions for each puzzle, separated by foldouts and spoilers. Let me know if you have any feedback and I can update the guide!
</p>
<p>
	In order to check hints for your current area, find the foldout for your area. Then open the foldout for the slider you are trying to get. For example, Village > Slider 8 will help explain how to get the 8th slider.

			<p>
				Slider is hard! Most of the people I watch often have to take breaks between playing because otherwise they get super fatigued and end up slogging through everything. If "Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and  expecting different results," then a lot of my friends must be insane when they play my game. When they come back, they often have a much better time  solving puzzles again.
			</p>
			<p>
				In general, each area's hardest puzzles are the 3rd and 6th tile puzzles. (This is because you have enough tiles for interesting interactions to happen, and it is before you get too many tiles that moving the grid is annoying!) The difficulty curve of each area is intentionally not smooth because it makes puzzles and challenges a bit more memorable.[a]

				Stonybrook Village is the first area in the game. It should help you get acquainted with how the world works and how the gameplay loop flows.

				<p>
					The game starts with you in your house. You pick up your Artifact off the floor and head outside to find the world in disarray. As you explore, you should be able to eventually find the 2nd Slider.
				</p>
				<p>
					Hint: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						Try moving the tile around and exploring everywhere. You can move on and off of your starting tile.
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					Solution: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						While on the starting tile, move to the top-right of the grid. There should be a small alcove area with a cow and the 2nd Slider.
