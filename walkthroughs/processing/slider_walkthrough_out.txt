	This is the walkthrough guide for <a href="../games/slider.html">Slider</a>. It includes hints and solutions for each puzzle, separated by foldouts and spoilers. Let me know if you have any feedback and I can update the guide!
</p>
<p>
	In order to check hints for your current area, find the foldout for your area. Then open the foldout for the slider you are trying to get. For example, Village > Slider 8 will help explain how to get the 8th slider.

			<summary class="header-1">General Advice</summary>

			<p>
				Slider is hard! Most of the people I watch often have to take breaks between playing because otherwise they get super fatigued and end up slogging through everything. If "Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and  expecting different results," then a lot of my friends must be insane when they play my game. When they come back, they often have a much better time  solving puzzles again.
			</p>
			<p>
				In general, each area's hardest puzzles are the 3rd and 6th tile puzzles. (This is because you have enough tiles for interesting interactions to happen, and it is before you get too many tiles that moving the grid is annoying!) The difficulty curve of each area is intentionally not smooth because it makes puzzles and challenges a bit more memorable.

			<summary class="header-1">Stonybrook Village</summary>

			<p>
				Stonybrook Village is the first area in the game. It will help you get acquainted with how the world works and how the gameplay loop flows. Fun fact: the original version of this area was made in just 48 hours for the 2021 GMTK game jam!
			</p>
			<details>
				<summary class="header-2">Slider 2</summary>

				<p>
					The game starts with you in your house. You pick up your Artifact off the floor and head outside to find the world in disarray. As you explore, you should be able to eventually find the 2nd Slider.
				</p>
				<p>
					Hint: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						Try moving the tile around and exploring everywhere. You can move on and off of your starting tile.
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					Solution: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						While on the starting tile, move to the top-right of the grid. Above you is a small alcove area with a cow and the 2nd Slider.
					</span>
				</p>
			</details>
			
			<details>
				<summary class="header-2">Slider 3</summary>

				<p>
					Soon after collecting the second tile, you can start to interact with traveling between tiles and the off-map sections on the edges. The third slider should be easy to access on the second tile.
				</p>
				<p>
					Solution: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						Talk to the Archeologist, the NPC on the slider near the ruins. If you keep talking to her will give you the 3rd slider.
					</span>
				</p>
			</details>
			
			<details>
				<summary class="header-2">Slider 4</summary>

				<p>
					With 3 sliders on the map, this is where things get a bit tricky. It seems like there is no way to get onto the 3rd slider with the 'U' shaped walls, but that's where the next piece is.
				</p>
				<p>
					Hint 1: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						Think outside the box!
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					Hint 2: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						Do you remember where you picked up the second slider collectible? Or perhaps, an inconspicuous cow on the map?
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					Solution: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						Get on the 1st slider with the house and move it to the top right. There, you can move to the off-map section of the world. After that, you can move the 'U' shaped tile to the top right and get on it.
					</span>
				</p>
			</details>
			
			<details>
				<summary class="header-2">Slider 5</summary>

				<p>
					The 4th slider has Kevin asking you to rearrange and untangle his buoys. You can pick up and place them wherever you need.
				</p>
				<p>
					Solution: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						You have to make sure none of the buoy lines are intersecting. It's probably easier if you move all of them to one side. You can pick a buoy to start with, and follow the line detangling them one by one.
					</span>
				</p>
			</details>
			
			<details>
				<summary class="header-2">Slider 6</summary>

				<p>
					The newest tile has another house -- and inside is an emotional support cat. How nice! Outside, Juliette is looking for her lover somewhere else on the map.
				</p>
				<p>
					Solution: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						To reunite the lovers, move the tile with the man next to the tile with the woman so that they can see each other. Those are the 1st tile (with a house, the walls are an L shape), and the most recent 5th tile (with the other house, the walls are a reversed L shape).
					</span>
				</p>
			</details>
			
			<details>
				<summary class="header-2">Slider 7</summary>

				<p>
					Our newest tile has a lot on it. Pierre, the fisherman, is asking for fish. There's also a waterfall and some ruins too.
				</p>
				<p>
					Hint 1: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						The fisherman is asking for fish, and the fish wants to get to the waterfall in the top-left of the map. However, there aren't enough water tiles to bridge the gap. There's another way to progress forward.
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					Hint 2: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						When you assemble part of the river (the waterfall tile 7 next to the straight river tile 2), some of the ruins on the top of the tile line up.
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					Solution Part 1: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						You need to assemble the ruins in the corner of 4 different tiles. You can see them in the world as well as on the corners of the icons on the map. One is on the top-right of the waterfall tile 6, one on the top-left of the horizontal river tile 2, one on the bottom-left of your starting tile 1, and the last on the bottom-right of the 'U' shaped tile 3.
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					Solution Part 2: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						Putting all 4 corners together creates a magical arrow which points you in a direction. If you follow the arrow to the tile it is pointing to (tile 5, below the house), there's a spot on the ground that is glowing. You can interact with it to dig up the next Slider.
					</span>
				</p>
			</details>

				<summary class="header-2">Slider 8</summary>

				<p>
					At last, the final river piece!
				</p>
				<p>
					Hint: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						Now that we have all 4 river tiles, we can finish the quest the fisherman by the waterfall and fish in the ocean had.
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					Solution: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						Assemble the river from the waterfall in the top-left to the ocean in the middle right. The order is waterfall in the top left (tile 6), horizontal river top middle (tile 2), corner top right with the buoys (tile 4), and finally the other corner you just got middle right (tile 7). Then, talking to the fish will populate the river and the fisherman by the waterfall will give you Slider 8.

				<p>
					With 8 sliders on the grid, moving things around is getting really tricky!
				</p>
				<details>
					<summary class="header-3">Chad</summary>

					<p>
						Chad has taken a piece of the ruins, but he won't let us take it from him. The dastardly man has jumped onto a rock with it too! There has to be a way to bring him down...
					</p>
					<p>
						Solution: 
						<span class="spoiler">
							If you give the tile a shake, Chad will lose his footing and fall off the rock. You can pick up the piece of the ruins and turn it into the Archeologist on the horizontal river tile.
						</span>
					</p>
				</details>
				
				<details>
					<summary class="header-3">8 Puzzle</summary>

					<p>
						After turning in the ruins piece to the Archeologist, she reads them out loud and the map shuffles! It's time to put everything back in its right place and solve the eight puzzle.
					</p>
					<p>
						Hint: 
						<span class="spoiler">
							When solving 8 puzzles, it's a bit tricky because you might have a lot of pieces correct but still be far from the solution. When I solve them, I like to get one row or column correct, then mess around with the final 5 pieces until it works.
						</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						Solution: 
						<span class="spoiler">
							Good luck :) <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Solve-Slide-Puzzles" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.wikihow.com/Solve-Slide-Puzzles</a>

			<summary class="header-1">Caves</summary>

			<p>
				Welcome to the Chloro Caves! What does Chloro mean? Chloro stands for chlorophyll. This zone introduces fungi, a new type of obstacle that you'll have to navigate. Fungi, of course, do not possess chlorophyll.
			</p>
			<details>
				<summary class="header-2">Slider 2</summary>

				<p>
					You start off with the first tile, having entered the caves from the south. If you're a crafty scoundrel, you may have found your way into the caves from a hidden entrance. On this tile, you'll find your first patch of fungi, and a Slider trapped within. But what other secrets do the caves hide?
				</p>
				<p>
					Hint: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						There are many areas on the edges of the map you can access with just this first tile. Explore a bit.
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					Solution: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						While on the starting tile, you can find the wrench in the bottom-left and the wire cutters in the top-left of the outside map. Return them to the worker at the top-right of the grid, who will turn on the light and give you the second Slider.
					</span>
				</p>
			</details>
			
			<details>
				<summary class="header-2">Slider 3</summary>

				<p>
					Some light will give you an opportunity to explore how the fungi works. Even better, Slider 3 is easily found with a little exploration.
				</p>
				<p>
					Solution: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						Use either of the lights to turn off the fungi on the tile you just got. Then, you can pick up the third Slider.
					</span>
				</p>
			</details>
			
			<details>
				<summary class="header-2">Slider 4</summary>

				<p>
					My god, another light! The fungi surely stand no chance against your electrical might now…
				</p>
				<p>
					Hint: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						Remember the Slider trapped in the fungi on tile 1?
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					Solution: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						Place the first tile in the top-right corner, exposing it to light from the right. Place the third tile underneath the first tile, exposing it to light from the bottom. This will remove enough fungi for you to grab Slider 4 from the first tile.
					</span>
				</p>
			</details>
			
			<details>
				<summary class="header-2">Slider 5</summary>

				<p>
					On this tile is the cavern station. The power's gone out, and it's so dark that you can't even see the door!
				</p>
				<p>
					Solution: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						Move the tile with the light underneath slider 4. This will allow you to enter the station. Upon entering the station, talk to Chad and you will receive Slider 5.
					</span>
				</p>
			</details>
			
			<details>
				<summary class="header-2">Slider 6</summary>

				<p>
					Here you'll find another light, though the cable has been chewed up by rats. The archeologist makes her triumphant return, but she seems to have lost yet another item! What a klutz!
				</p>
				<p>
					Hint: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						You'll need to use the light on this tile in order to reach the flashlight, which is located on the slider with the big bridge.
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					Solution Part 1: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						Pick up the key collectible from Slider 5, and return it to the worker on the left inside the cavern station. This will allow you to switch on power, powering the light on Slider 5 if it is to the left of the cavern station. You can also see the power line on the map, which lights up yellow once powered.
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					Solution Part 2: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						Find the tile with the flashlight (the second slider you got, with the river and large bridge), and place lights above and to the left. That will allow you to access the flashlight in the fungi patch. Return it to the archeologist and pick up Slider 6.
					</span>

				<summary class="header-2">Slider 7</summary>

				<p>
					This tile is dominated by a massive field of fungi, with Slider 7 deep inside. You'll have to make full use of what you've learned so far to solve the puzzle, but it is possible!
				</p>
				<p>
					Hint: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						This puzzle requires multiple moves, keep that in mind when setting up your grid.
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					Solution: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						Place the power station light in the center of the grid, the other light tile in the top left, and Slider 6 in the top middle. Enter the fungi field, and stand in the row where there is no rock on the right side. Slide Slider 6 to the right, and then move the single light tile underneath Slider 6. You can then pick up Slider 7.
					</span>

				<summary class="header-2">Slider 8</summary>

				<p>
					What's this? A rat has stolen Slider 8, and is now running away! Time for your best Tom and Jerry impression. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Hint: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						The rat is faster, but you're smarter. Take advantage of the mechanics you've used so far, and your ability to move them.
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					Solution: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						You can either corner the rat to catch it or chase it onto some removed fungi and then take away the light to regrow it. Either way, you now have Slider 8.
					</span>
				</p>
			</details>
			
			<details>
				<summary class="header-2">Slider 9</summary>

				<p>
					The archeologist has already made a great discovery on tile 8, but she can't quite read the runes. Light up the entire map!
				</p>
				<p>
					Solution: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						There are multiple configurations that may work, note that tiles change color when they are fully lit. If you want some direction to work towards, the "correct" tile configuration is also a valid solution (the missing tile will be in the bottom-left). If you've completed the final puzzle in Stonybrook Village, this will be a breeze. When the caves are lit, a short cutscene will play, and then you'll receive Slider 9.

				The Shifting Seas is Slider's water level. Like most water levels, there's a twist: instead of sliding tiles around, you rotate them. There's a lot to do and explore!
			</p>
			<details>
				<summary class="header-2">Slider 2</summary>

				<p>
					Click on the arrows in the artifact in order to rotate tiles around.
				</p>
				<p>
					Solution:

				<p>
					With the tavern unlocked, you can meet Bob and some tavern goers. Bob won't respect you without an anchor though :(. There's a Slider in the corner, blocked by pirates playing a game of dice. If you can defeat them, it's all yours.
				</p>
				<p>
					Hint: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						You may have lost the initial roll, but you can still shake up the dice.
					</span> 
				</p>
				<p>
					Solution: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						After rolling, if you move the tile, it will increment the number on the dice. Move the tavern tile two times so that your total adds up to 11. You'll win the game and claim Slider 3

				<summary class="header-2">Slider 4</summary>

				<p>
					Finally, the Anchor, one of the most powerful artifacts in Slider! It allows you to pin down a tile.
				</p>
				<p>
					Solution: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						In order to grab the Anchor, you need to be in the water and move adjacent to it. Then you can pick it up with 'E' (or whatever key action is bound to) and store it with 'Q' (or whatever key cycle is bound to). Once you have the anchor, return to Bob.

					With the 4th slider unlocked, you can visit it and find the wizard Fezziwig. He's trying to cast a spell that moves tiles around, but he keeps falling off his rock.
				</p>
				<p>
					Hint: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						You have a tool that can pin down movement.
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					Solution: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						Place the anchor on the tile Fezziwig is on in order to stop him from moving. You can then pick up his Magical Gem reward and turn it into Bob to upgrade your Tavern Pass.

				<summary class="header-2">The Open Seas</summary>

				<p>
					After you turn in Fezziwig's reward, Bob gives you the rest of the tiles in the area. How generous! Thus, you set off on a journey to plunder the seas of all their treasure. Each item can be turned into Bob in order to upgrade your Tavern Pass. You can finish it when you turn in all of them. 
				</p>

					You can ask Bob for hints in the game as well.

					<summary class="header-3">Shipwreck</summary>

					<p>
						The shipwreck is the easiest of all the new puzzles.
					</p>
					<p>
						Solution: 
						<span class="spoiler">
							You need to assemble the two pieces of the shipwreck on the map. If you investigate the area around it, you'll find a glowing spot you can interact with to dig up a Treasure Chest.

						Kevin is back on one of the beaches and asks for your help to untangle his buoys again.
					</p>
					<p>
						Solution: 
						<span class="spoiler">
							It can help if you move the three main island pieces to the top-right in their respective spots. Otherwise just keep trying to move the buoys to the correct spots.

					<summary class="header-3">Volcano</summary>

					<p>
						The Volcano puzzle requires you to place the volcano in the middle, and surround it with the other tiles with rocks.
					</p>
					<p>
						Solution: 
						<span class="spoiler">
							After placing the volcano tile in the middle, you can anchor it and rotate the other tiles until 3 of the rocks line up. You can tell they line up when the blue orb appears over them. For the last one, try anchoring one of the outer tiles instead of the volcano to finish adjusting.

					<summary class="header-3">The Foggy Seas</summary>

					<p>
						The Foggy Seas require you to travel the two foggy tiles in a specific order. You can get clues from several sources around the ocean.
					</p>
					<p>
						Hint 1: 
						<span class="spoiler">
							The hints are given from Bob, the short child Ike in the tavern, and behind the tavern under the coconuts.
						</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						Hint 2: 
						<span class="spoiler">
							The sequence is West, South, West, West, North, West.
						</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						Solution: 
						<span class="spoiler">
							Start with both foggy tiles next to each other horizontally. Then, move from the right tile West, and it will light up one of the notes. Then, rotate the tiles so the other one is below yours, and move South onto it. The second note will be lit up. Continue this for West, West, North, West, until all 6 notes light up and reveal a hidden island.

					<p>
						Romeo and Juliette are seeking each other again. Romeo is on the top-left of the map trying to send a note to Juliette on the bottom-right, but it keeps sinking before it reaches her.
					</p>
					<p>
						Hint 1: 
						<span class="spoiler">
							The bottle moves once whenever you move any tiles, and sinks after two moves. This means you have to get it to Juliette in two moves.
						</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						Hint 2: 
						<span class="spoiler">
							The solution involves the Anchor.
						</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						Solution: 
						<span class="spoiler">
							In order to move the bottle in two moves from the top-left to bottom-right, you need to make two diagonal moves. This can be done with the Anchor. If you put an anchor on the top-center or left-center tiles, you can rotate the tiles so that one of them makes a diagonal move. You can pick up the anchor and repeat the process to deliver the bottle with 2 diagonal moves.

							In order to beat Chad, you have to move faster than him. You can use the Artifact to move a tile, which moves faster than Chad. While you can't break the race track, you can move other tiles. To win, set up the race track and place a tile below your starting point. Start the race, hop onto the other tile, and move it all the way to the right.

			<p>
				The Rocket Factory is probably Slider's hardest area. It formally introduces power, wires, conveyors, and timed gates. It is also super puzzle dense.
			</p>
			<details>
				<summary class="header-2">How do Timed Gates Work?</summary>

				<p>
					This section is here to spell out how timed gates work, in case you have any confusion about them! Part of the fun is figuring them out and finding the edge cases you can exploit, but it's also spelled out here in case it gets frustrating.
				</p>
				<p>
					The goal of the timed gates is to power all of its inputs within a certain number of moves. You can see the inputs that you need to power as batteries near the gate, or also the LED indicators on the actual gate itself. If you can power all of them, then the gate will stay on forever.
				</p>
				<p>
					The large number on the gate represents how many tile moves you have left. If the gate has a 2 on it, then you only have two tile moves to power the entire gate. Conveyors do not count towards this limit!
				</p>
				<p>
					The moves are only counted once they <i>completely</i> finish though. This means that you can chain together conveyor belt moves in order to squeeze more out of the very last moves.
				</p>
			</details>
			
			<details>
				<summary class="header-2">Slider 1</summary>

				<p>
					You can enter the Factory from the Jungle once you fix the minecart rail line and prove you have the Scroll of Realigning from the Desert. Once inside, you can talk to some NPCs and are introduced to the Timed Gate mechanic.
				</p>
				<p>
					The first slider is in a closet above the starting area.
				</p>
				<p>
					Solution: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						You'll have to activate the timed gate with the broken screen and power all three buttons connected to it. This will open the door and let you pick up the 1st Slider.
					</span>
				</p>

					We finally have a slider on the map! We still have to get onto it and explore a bit before we find more Sliders though.
				</p>
				<p>
					Timed Gate: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						To leave the starting area, you'll have to activate the timed gate below the door. This has a button for one of the power sources you can stand on, and the other is a wire which connects to our new tile. Moving the tile may reset the timed gate since it only allows two tile moves.
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					Hint: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						You can use your anchor to hold the button down while you explore areas the door unlocks for you.
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					Solution: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						Once you are in the top-right part of the map, hitting the switch will open the door (and turn on the conveyor, stranding you). You can then move the conductive bob inside back and forth to get through to the other Slider.

					Hard Timed Gate Hint 1:

					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					Hard Timed Gate Hint 3: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						Conveyors can move anchored tiles.
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					Solution Part 1: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						Start with the top-right conveyor turned off. Set up the tiles so that the one with the door on the right is on the center-right. Then, put the first tile with the door on top in the top-right, and the tile with magnets in the top-center.
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					Solution Part 2: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						Turn on the bathroom timed gate. Place your anchor on the top-right tile and turn on the conveyor to move it down. The timed gate should have one of the lines powered without using any moves. You can then walk onto the other magnet tile. Stand on the button and move the slider onto the conveyor. This will power the second line before the move finishes.

					With the 4th tile, you are asked to gather several parts in order to 3D print the next Slider. They can be found in 3 different locations around the factory. After you get all 3 pieces you can use the 3D printer and it will make the next slider for you.
				</p>
				<p>
					Locations: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						The Base is on the same tile as the printer, the Walls are in the top-left of the Factory, and the Wires are in the bottom-right of the Factory.
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					Hint: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						One of the parts requires you to get a second item. You have the Anchor already, but you need to somehow free the Conductive Bob from the gated area in the top-right of the map so that you can use it.
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					Base Solution: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						In order to access the base, you need to power both lines to open both doors. To do this, you need two items, like the above hint mentions. You can free the Conductive Bob by using the Anchor to conduct the two pylons through the holes in the gate. The you can walk in and pick up the Conductive Bob, and then leave. After that, you can use the Anchor and the Bob to open both doors.
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					Walls Solution: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						The walls are behind the giant door in the top-left of the factory. You can power the timed gate near it using the tile with the printer.
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					Wires Solution: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						The wires are in the bottom-right of the Factory. Normally, the conveyor in the way will move tiles so you can't get there. However, if you jam three tiles in the bottom row of the grid, then the conveyor won't be able to push the tile and you can walk to the bottom of the Factory.

						Use the conveyors to your advantage, especially the window you have while the timed gate is flashing 0.
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					Solution: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						One solution is to set up the grid so that the server room tile is in the bottom-center and the tile with the wire pointing to the right is in the right-center. You can turn on the Timed Gate and walk to stand on the button to power it. Then, move the tile down so that you create a chain reaction of moves that will power all the WiFi points. You may need to clear some tiles out of the way or power more conveyors.

					Now, it's time to power the Mega Crystal! But, it needs 6 inputs? And it uses a 0 gate?!
				</p>
				<p>
					Hint 1: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						If you try and set it up so that all the inputs are powered at the same time, you'll quickly notice that you need some tiles to be in multiple positions at the same time. Which isn't possible!
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					Hint 2: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						Timed Gates will stay active as long as a tile is moving.
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					Solution Part 1: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						In order to solve the puzzle, you need to set up a loop of conveyors so that they're always moving. That way, each of the inputs can be powered as the loop moves tiles around the Mega Crystal. 
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					Solution Part 2: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						First, use the conveyor override to make sure the conveyor belts aren't active. Then power all of the conveyor belts around the factory. Finally, before you re-enable them, make sure that the server room is powered so that the top two inputs can be powered during the loop. Turn on the conveyor loop and watch as everything gets powered! You'll need to stand on buttons or use the Anchor or Conductive Bob to weigh them down. Make sure to not power the magnets such that they stop the tile and the loop.
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					Solution Part 3: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						After the Crystal is powered, it will overload and cause a black out. You'll then have to use the crystal tile to power the server room and talk to Gene to run the server script. This will reset everything, but also send you to the past.

				The Military region has you fighting, commanding your Robot army to defeat the apathetic Aliens. You get as many tries as you want to win this rock-paper-scissors area.
			</p>
			<p>
				This area features a lot of randomness, so there is no explicit solution. However, we can try to give some tips.
			</p>
			<p>
				- Try to win as often as you can (or tie if you can't). The first few waves of aliens will always go the same, but then it's up to you to maximize your potential.
			</p>
			<p>
				- You don't have to use the supply reinforcements right away. Oftentimes it can be worth it to consider waiting until a better moment to create the troop.
			</p>
			<p>
				- There are six waves total, with an increasing number of enemies. Additionally you will get a reinforcement roughly for every other Slider you pick up.
			</p>
			<p>
				-The next wave will spawn once all the aliens in the current wave are defeated. Once there are 1-2 aliens left, try to rearrange the map and toops to prepare for the next wave.
			</p>
			<p>
				-Try to keep the map as open as possible. It's easier to escape a bad situation by sliding 2-3 tiles away vs moving a flag. Place sliders with walls near the edge of the map.

				<summary class="header-2">Accessing the Mountain</summary>

				<p>
					Accessing the mountain is less straightforward than other areas. Per the directions of the Factory's Foreman, you can follow the rail line from the factory to the Chloro Caves. Unfortunately, that entrance is blocked, and you'll have to find another way in.
				</p>
				<p>
					Hint: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						That massive door in the caves has a split power line attached to it.
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					Solution: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						Use the anchor to bridge the gap in the wire on the top-left tile in the caves. This will open the large door, granting access to the Crystal Mines.

				<p>
					Hint: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						Ice melts when within range of lava and freezes when on the top layer with no lava in range.
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					Solution: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						Move the slider so you can walk on it. Move it to the top layer to freeze the small ice patch and walk to Bobbyjim. Move the tile back to the bottom left corner of the lower layer in order to melt the ice around Bobbyjim.

				<p>
					A basement resides on Slider 2, but the door is locked and blocked by a frozen crate. You'll need to find a way to break the crate and obtain the key.

				<p>
					Hint 1: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						What large, heavy, metal object do you have that's perfect for smashing stuff? Now that you're in 3D, take head of gravity.

				</p>
				<p>
					Solution Part 1: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						Use the anchor to smash the crate in front of the door.
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					Solution Part 2: ||Set up the Slider with the lava bucket on the bottom row of the bottom layer. Place the Slider with the basement on it in the top row of the top layer. The lava will drip over the edge and fill the bucket. Talk to Bobbyjim to get the key. Once inside the basement, smash a few crates to get the frozen Slider. You can break it with the anchor or pick it up and bring it near a lava source to melt it.

				<p>
					Hint 1: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						The river that runs along the left side of the top layer can provide flowing water.
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					Hint 2: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						How have you gotten rid of ice before? You'll need a different method for each gear.
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					Solution Part 1: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						On the top layer, put the water wheel Slider in the bottom left and the basement Slider above it. The lava will melt the top gear. Place the remaining Slider under the waterwheel, then use the anchor to break the ice on the bottom gear.
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					Solution Part 2: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						Bert the craftsman in the bottom left corner of the lower level will give you a toolbox free of charge. Bring it back to the waterwheel worker to fix the gears. Once the waterwheel is in position and both gears are unfrozen, it will generate power.

						Sara, a researcher from the MRI, is investigating the crystal extractor. To help with her research, use the minecart to fill the extractor with crystals. Watch out; if you move a tile while the minecart is full of crystals, they will be destroyed!
					</p>

						Hint: 
						<span class="spoiler">
							You can form a single, continuous track from the powered rails to the crystal depositor to the crystal extractor. Make sure to pay attention to which direction the junctions are pointing.

					<p>
						Solution: ||Place the crystal extractor slider in the bottom left of the lower layer. To the right put the basement slider, and above it place the waterwheel slider. Place the remaining slider in the last spot on the bottom layer. Make sure the switches on the basement tile are both on and the upper switch of the crystal loop is off. Send the minecart around the track and watch it pick up and deposit a crystal.

						You should already have one oil. Pick up the second oil on the top right of the rocket tile. Line up the rocket, portal, and laser tiles from left to right, then blow up the rock in the past rocket tile. For the present rock, first line up the rocket, hungry worker tile, and laser on the bottom row, and anchor the present laser tile. The laser should reflect upwards in the middle. Place the portal in the middle of the left side with the museum above it, then place the present explodable rock in the top right corner. Move to the past. There should be a path to desync the past laser tile and move it to the center of the top row. Move the portal one tile right to the center and the rocket up one tile. The laser should start on the bottom right, reflect up into the portal in the middle, loop counter-clockwise in the past, and come out the right side of the present portal.
