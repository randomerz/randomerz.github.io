<p>
	This is the walkthrough guide for <a href="../games/slider.html">Slider</a>. It includes hints and solutions for each puzzle, separated by foldouts and spoilers. Let me know if you have any feedback and I can update the guide!
</p>
<p>
	In order to check hints for your current area, find the foldout for your area. Then open the foldout for the slider you are trying to get. For example, Village > Slider 8 will help explain how to get the 8th slider.

			<p>
				Slider is hard! Most of the people I watch often have to take breaks between playing because otherwise they get super fatigued and end up slogging through everything. If "Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and  expecting different results," then a lot of my friends must be insane when they play my game. When they come back, they often have a much better time  solving puzzles again.
			</p>
			<p>
				In general, each area's hardest puzzles are the 3rd and 6th tile puzzles. (This is because you have enough tiles for interesting interactions to happen, and it is before you get too many tiles that moving the grid is annoying!) The difficulty curve of each area is intentionally not smooth because it makes puzzles and challenges a bit more memorable.

			<p>
				Stonybrook Village is the first area in the game. It should help you get acquainted with how the world works and how the gameplay loop flows.
			</p>
			<details>
				<summary class="header-2">Slider 2</summary>

				<p>
					The game starts with you in your house. You pick up your Artifact off the floor and head outside to find the world in disarray. As you explore, you should be able to eventually find the 2nd Slider.
				</p>
				<p>
					Hint: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						Try moving the tile around and exploring everywhere. You can move on and off of your starting tile.
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					Solution: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						While on the starting tile, move to the top-right of the grid. Above you is a small alcove area with a cow and the 2nd Slider.
					</span>
				</p>
			</details>
			
			<details>
				<summary class="header-2">Slider 3</summary>

				<p>
					Soon after collecting the second tile, you can start to interact with traveling between tiles and the off-map sections on the edges. The third slider should be easy to access on the second tile.
				</p>
				<p>
					Solution: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						Talk to the Archeologist, the NPC on the slider near the ruins. If you keep talking to her she should give you the 3rd slider.
					</span>
				</p>
			</details>
			
			<details>
				<summary class="header-2">Slider 4</summary>

				<p>
					With 3 sliders on the map, this is where things get a bit tricky. It seems like there is no way to get onto the 3rd slider with the ‘U' shaped walls, but that's where the next piece is.
				</p>
				<p>
					Hint 1: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						Think outside the box!
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					Hint 2: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						Do you remember where you picked up the second slider collectible? Or perhaps, an inconspicuous cow on the map?
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					Solution: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						Get on the 1st slider with the house and move it to the top right. There, you can move to the off-map section of the world. After that, you should be able to move the ‘U' shaped tile to the top right and get on it.
					</span>
				</p>
			</details>
			
			<details>
				<summary class="header-2">Slider 5</summary>

				<p>
					Now with 4 sliders, it should be easier to move around on the map. The 4th slider has Kevin asking you to rearrange and untangle his buoys. You can pick up and place them wherever you need.
				</p>
				<p>
					Solution: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						You have to make sure none of the buoy lines are intersecting. It's probably easier if you move all of them to one side. You can pick a buoy to start with, and follow the line detangling them one by one.
					</span>
				</p>
			</details>
			
			<details>
				<summary class="header-2">Slider 6</summary>

				<p>
					The newest tile has another house -- and inside is an emotional support cat. How nice! Outside, Juliette is looking for her lover somewhere else on the map.
				</p>
				<p>
					Solution: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						To reunite the lovers, move the tile with the man next to the tile with the woman so that they can see each other. This should be the 1st tile (with a house, the walls are an L shape), and the most recent 5th tile (with the other house, the walls are a reversed L shape).
					</span>
				</p>
			</details>
			
			<details>
				<summary class="header-2">Slider 7</summary>

				<p>
					Our newest tile has a lot on it. Pierre, the fisherman, is asking for fish. There's also a waterfall and some ruins too.
				</p>
				<p>
					Hint 1: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						The fisherman is asking for fish, and the fish want to get to the waterfall in the top-left of the map. However, there aren't enough water tiles to bridge the gap. There's another way to progress forward.
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					Hint 2: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						When you assemble part of the river (the waterfall tile 7 next to the straight river tile 2), some of the ruins on the top of the tile line up.
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					Solution Part 1: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						You need to assemble the ruins in the corner of 4 different tiles. You can see them in the world as well as on the corners of the icons on the map. One is on the top-right of the waterfall tile 6, one on the top-left of the horizontal river tile 2, one on the bottom-left of your starting tile 1, and the last on the bottom-right of the ‘U' shaped tile 3.
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					Solution Part 2: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						Putting all 4 corners together should create a magical arrow which points you in a direction. If you follow the arrow to the tile it is pointing to (tile 5, below the house), there's a spot on the ground that should be glowing. You can interact with it to dig up the next slider.
					</span>
				</p>
			</details>
			
			<details>
				<summary class="header-2">Slider 8</summary>

				<p>
					At last, the final river piece!
				</p>
				<p>
					Hint: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						Now that we have all 4 river sliders, we can finish the quest the fisherman by the waterfall and fish in the ocean had.
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					Solution: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						Assemble the river from the waterfall in the top-left to the ocean in the middle right. The order should be waterfall in the top left (tile 6), horizontal river top middle (tile 2), corner top right with the buoys (tile 4), and finally the other corner you just got middle right (tile 7). Then, talking to the fish should populate the river and the fisherman by the waterfall will give you Slider 8.
					</span>

				<summary class="header-2">Slider 9</summary>

				<p>
					With 8 sliders on the grid, moving things around is getting really tricky!
				</p>
				<details>
					<summary class="header-3">Chad</summary>

					<p>
						Chad has taken a piece of the ruins, but he won't let us take it from him. The dastardly man has jumped onto a rock with it too! There has to be a way to bring him down...
					</p>
					<p>
						Solution: 
						<span class="spoiler">
							If you give the tile a shake, Chad will lose his footing and fall off the rock. You should be able to pick up the piece of the ruins and turn it into the Archeologist on the horizontal river tile.
						</span>
					</p>
				</details>
				
				<details>
					<summary class="header-3">Part 2</summary>

					<p>
						After turning in the ruins piece to the Archeologist, she reads them out loud and the map shuffles! It's time to put everything back in its right place and solve the eight puzzle.
					</p>
					<p>
						Hint: 
						<span class="spoiler">
							When solving 8 puzzles, it's a bit tricky because you might have a lot of pieces correct but still be far from the solution. When I solve them, I like to get one row or column correct, then mess around with the final 5 pieces until it works.
						</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						Solution: 
						<span class="spoiler">
							Good luck :) <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Solve-Slide-Puzzles" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.wikihow.com/Solve-Slide-Puzzles</a>

				The Shifting Seas fills the role of being this game's water level. Instead of sliding tiles around, you rotate them. There's a lot to do and explore!
			</p>
			<details>
				<summary class="header-2">Slider 2</summary>

				<p>
					Click on the arrows in the artifact in order to rotate tiles around.
				</p>
				<p>
					Solution: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						Move onto the first tile and walk over to the X. If you interact with the X, an NPC should appear, thanking you and giving you the next piece.
					</span>

				<summary class="header-2">Slider 3</summary>

				<p>
					With the tavern unlocked, you should be able to meet Bob and some tavern goers. Bob won't respect you without an anchor though :(. You should be able to win at a game of dice though.
				</p>
				<p>
					Hint: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						You may have lost the initial roll, but you can still shake up the dice.
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					Solution: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						If you move the tile, it will increment the number on the dice. Move the tavern tile a total of two times so that your total adds up to 11.
					</span>
				</p>
			</details>
			
			<details>
				<summary class="header-2">Slider 4</summary>

				<p>
					Finally, the Anchor! One of the most powerful artifacts in Slider, it allows you to pin down a tile.
				</p>
				<p>
					Solution: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						In order to grab the anchor, you need to be in the water and move adjacent to it. Then you should be able to pick it up with 'e' and store it with 'q'. Once you have the anchor, return to Bob.
					</span>
				</p>
			</details>
			
			<details>
				<summary class="header-2">Slider 5</summary>

				<p>
					With the 4th slider unlocked, you can visit it and find the wizard Fezziwig. He's trying to cast a spell that moves tiles around, but he keeps falling off his rock.
				</p>
				<p>
					Hint: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						You have a tool that can pin down movement.
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					Solution: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						Place the anchor on the tile Fezziwig is on in order to stop him from moving. You can then pick up his Magical Gem reward and turn it into Bob to upgrade your Tavern Pass.
					</span>
				</p>
			</details>
			
			<details>
				<summary class="header-2">The Open Seas</summary>

				<p>
					After you turn in Fezziwig's reward, Bob gives you the rest of the tiles in the area. How generous! Thus, you set off on a journey to plunder the seas of all their treasure. Each item can be turned into Bob in order to upgrade your Tavern Pass. You can finish it when you turn in all of them. 
				</p>
				<p>
					You can ask Bob for hints in the game as well.
				</p>
				<details>
					<summary class="header-3">Shipwreck</summary>

					<p>
						The shipwreck is the easiest of all the new puzzles!
					</p>
					<p>
						Solution: 
						<span class="spoiler">
							You need to assemble the two pieces of the shipwreck on the map. If you investigate the area around it, you'll find a glowing spot you can interact with to dig up a Treasure Chest.
						</span>
					</p>
				</details>
				
				<details>
					<summary class="header-3">Buoys</summary>

					<p>
						Kevin is back on one of the beaches and asks for your help to untangle his buoys again.
					</p>
					<p>
						Solution: 
						<span class="spoiler">
							It can help if you move the three main island pieces to the top-right in their respective spots. Otherwise just keep trying to move the buoys to the correct spots.
						</span>
					</p>
				</details>
				
				<details>
					<summary class="header-3">Volcano</summary>

					<p>
						The Volcano puzzle requires you to place the volcano in the middle, and surround it with the other tiles with rocks.
					</p>
					<p>
						Solution: 
						<span class="spoiler">
							After placing the tile in the middle, you can anchor it and rotate the other tiles until 3 of the rocks line up. You can tell they line up when the blue orb appears over them. For the last one, try anchoring one of the outer tiles instead of the volcano to finish adjusting.
						</span>
					</p>
				</details>
				
				<details>
					<summary class="header-3">The Foggy Seas</summary>

					<p>
						The Foggy Seas require you to travel the two foggy tiles in a specific order. You can get clues from several sources around the ocean.
					</p>
					<p>
						Hint 1: 
						<span class="spoiler">
							The hints are given from Bob, the short child Ike in the tavern, and behind the tavern under the coconuts.
						</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						Hint 2: 
						<span class="spoiler">
							The sequence is West, South, West, West, North, West.
						</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						Solution: 
						<span class="spoiler">
							Start with both foggy tiles next to each other horizontally. Then, move from the right tile West, and it should light up one of the notes. Then, rotate the tiles so the other one is below yours, and move South onto it. The second note should be lit up. Continue this for West, West, North, West, and all 6 notes should light up.
						</span>
					</p>
				</details>
				
				<details>
					<summary class="header-3">Romeo and Juliette</summary>

					<p>
						Romeo and Juliette are seeking each other again. Romeo is on the top-left of the map trying to send a note to Juliette on the bottom-right, but it keeps sinking before it reaches her.
					</p>
					<p>
						Hint 1: 
						<span class="spoiler">
							The bottle moves once whenever you move any tiles, and sinks after two moves. This means you have to get it to Juliette in two moves.
						</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						Hint 2: 
						<span class="spoiler">
							The solution involves the Anchor.
						</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						Solution: 
						<span class="spoiler">
							In order to move the bottle in two moves from the top-left to bottom-right, you need to make two diagonal moves. This can be done with the Anchor. If you put an anchor on the top-center or left-center tiles, you can rotate the tiles so that it makes a diagonal move. You can pick up the anchor and repeat the process to deliver the bottle with 2 diagonal moves.
						</span>
					</p>
				</details>

			<details>
				<summary class="header-2">Wrapping Up</summary>

				<p>
					After collecting all of the treasures from the seas, Bob asks you to put everything back to where it should be, one last time. You only need to place the three main island pieces in the top right, as well as the other shipwreck piece in the top left.
				</p>
				<p>
					Then, Bob cuts down the trees blocking the way to the Jungle.

							In order to beat Chad, you have to move faster than him. You can use the Artifact to move a tile, which moves faster than Chad. While you can't break the race track, you can move other tiles. To win, set up the race track and place a tile below your starting point. Start the race, hop onto the other tile, and move it all the way to the right.
