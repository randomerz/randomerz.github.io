<p>
	This is the walkthrough guide for <a href="../games/slider.html">Slider</a>. It includes hints and solutions for each puzzle, separated by foldouts and spoilers. Let me know if you have any feedback and I can update the guide!
</p>
<p>
	In order to check hints for your current area, find the foldout for your area. Then open the foldout for the slider you are trying to get. For example, Village > Slider 8 will help explain how to get the 8th slider.

			<p>
				Slider is hard! Most of the people I watch often have to take breaks between playing because otherwise they get super fatigued and end up slogging through everything. If "insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and  expecting different results," then a lot of my friends must be insane when they play my game. When they come back, they often have a much better time  solving puzzles again.
			</p>
			<p>
				In general, each area's hardest puzzles are the 3rd and 6th tile puzzles. (This is because you have enough tiles for interesting interactions to happen, and it is before you get too many tiles that moving the grid is annoying!) The difficulty curve of each area is intentionally not smooth because it makes puzzles and challenges a bit more memorable.
			</p>

				If you want a video walkthrough, someone posted a full completion of the game on YouTube as well (Thank you @dogedeaf)! You can find it with timestamps in the pinned comment here: <a href="https://youtu.be/BI7BdPrJBok" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://youtu.be/BI7BdPrJBok</a>

			<p>
				Stonybrook Village is the first area in the game. It will help you get acquainted with how the world works and how the gameplay loop flows. Fun fact: the original version of this area was made in just 48 hours for the 2021 GMTK game jam!
			</p>

				<summary class="header-2">Slider 2</summary>

				<p>
					The game starts with you in your house. You pick up The Artifact off the floor and head outside to find the world in disarray. As you explore, you should be able to eventually find the 2nd Slider.
				</p>
				<p>
					Hint: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						Try moving the tile around and exploring everywhere. You can move on and off of your starting tile.
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					Solution: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						While on the starting tile, move to the top-right of the grid. Above you is a small alcove area with a cow and the 2nd Slider.
					</span>
				</p>
			</details>
			
			<details>
				<summary class="header-2">Slider 3</summary>

				<p>
					Soon after collecting the second tile, you can start to interact with traveling between tiles and the off-map sections on the edges. The third slider should be easy to access on the second tile.
				</p>
				<p>
					Solution: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						Move the tile with the house to the left of the tile with the river section. Talk to the Archeologist, the NPC on the slider, near the ruins. If you keep talking to her, she will give you the 3rd slider.
					</span>
				</p>
			</details>
			
			<details>
				<summary class="header-2">Slider 4</summary>

				<p>
					With 3 sliders on the map, this is where things get a bit tricky. It seems like there is no way to get onto the 3rd slider with the 'U' shaped walls, but that's where the next piece is.
				</p>
				<p>
					Hint 1: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						Think outside the box!
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					Hint 2: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						Do you remember where you picked up the second Slider collectible? Or perhaps, an inconspicuous cow on the map?
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					Solution: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						Get on the 1st slider with the house and move it to the middle right. Walk off the tile to the right and walk down to grab the coffee from the beach. Get back on the tile and move it to the top right. There, you can walk to the off-map section of the world. After that, you can move the 'U' shaped tile to the top right and get on it.
					</span>

				<p>
					The 4th slider has Kevin asking you to rearrange and untangle his buoys. You can pick up and place them wherever you need.
				</p>
				<p>
					Solution: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						You have to make sure none of the buoy lines are intersecting. It's probably easier if you move all of them to one side. You can pick a buoy to start with, and follow the line detangling them one by one. To get around the river, you'll have to move other Sliders next to the tile with the buoys on it

				<p>
					The newest tile has another house -- and inside is an emotional support cat. How nice! Outside, Juliette is looking for her lover somewhere else on the map.
				</p>
				<p>
					Solution: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						To reunite the lovers, move the tile with the man next to the tile with the woman so that they can see each other. Those are the 1st tile (with a house, the walls are an L shape), and the most recent 5th tile (with the other house, the walls are a reversed L shape).
					</span>

				<p>
					Our newest tile has a lot on it. Pierre, the fisherman, is asking for fish. There's also a waterfall and some ruins too.
				</p>
				<p>
					Hint 1: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						The fisherman is asking for fish, and the fish wants to get to the waterfall in the top-left of the map. However, there aren't enough water tiles to bridge the gap. There's another way to progress forward.
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					Hint 2: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						When you assemble part of the river (the waterfall tile 6 next to the straight river tile 2), some of the ruins on the top of the tile line up.
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					Solution Part 1: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						You need to assemble the ruins in the corner of 4 different tiles. You can see them in the world as well as on the corners of the icons on the map. One is on the top-right of the waterfall tile 6, one on the top-left of the horizontal river tile 2, one on the bottom-left of your starting tile 1, and the last on the bottom-right of the 'U' shaped tile 3.
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					Solution Part 2: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						Putting all 4 corners together creates a magical arrow which points you in a direction. If you follow the arrow to the tile it is pointing to (tile 5, below the house), there's a rock on the ground that is glowing. You can interact with it to dig up the next Slider.
					</span>

				<summary class="header-2">Slider 8</summary>

				<p>
					At last, the final river piece!
				</p>
				<p>
					Hint: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						Now that we have all 4 river tiles, we can finish the quest the fisherman by the waterfall and fish in the ocean had.
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					Solution: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						Assemble the river from the waterfall in the top-left to the ocean in the middle right. The order is waterfall in the top left (tile 6), horizontal river top middle (tile 2), corner top right with the buoys (tile 4), and finally the other corner you just got middle right (tile 7). Then, talking to the fish will populate the river and the fisherman by the waterfall will give you Slider 8.

					<summary class="header-3">Chad</summary>

					<p>
						Chad has taken a relic, but he won't let us take it from him. The dastardly man has jumped onto a rock with it too! There has to be a way to bring him down...
					</p>
					<p>
						Solution: 
						<span class="spoiler">
							If you give the tile a shake, Chad will lose his footing and fall off the rock. You can pick up the relic and turn it into the Archeologist on the horizontal river tile.
						</span>

					<summary class="header-3">8 Puzzle</summary>

					<p>
						After turning in the relic piece to the Archeologist, she reads them out loud and the map shuffles! It's time to put everything back in its right place and solve the eight puzzle.
					</p>
					<p>
						Hint: 
						<span class="spoiler">
							When solving 8 puzzles, it's a bit tricky because you might have a lot of pieces correct but still be far from the solution. If you have a single row/column with 3 correct tiles, then you can solve the puzzle by only moving the remaining 5 tiles, without touching the 3 in the row/column
						</span>

			<summary class="header-1">Chloro Caves</summary>

			<p>
				Welcome to the Chloro Caves! What does Chloro mean? Chloro stands for chlorophyll. This zone introduces fungi, a new type of obstacle that you'll have to navigate. Fungi, of course, do not possess chlorophyll.
			</p>
			<details>
				<summary class="header-2">Slider 2</summary>

				<p>
					You start off with the first tile, having entered the caves from the south. If you're a crafty scoundrel, you may have found your way into the caves from a hidden entrance. On this tile, you'll find your first patch of fungi, and a Slider trapped within. But what other secrets do the caves hide?
				</p>
				<p>
					Hint: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						There are many areas on the edges of the map you can access with just this first tile. Explore a bit.
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					Solution: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						While on the starting tile, you can find the wrench in the bottom-left and the wire cutters in the top-left of the outside map. Return them to the worker at the top-right of the grid, who will turn on the light and give you the second Slider.
					</span>

				<summary class="header-2">Slider 3</summary>

				<p>
					Some light will give you an opportunity to explore how the fungi works. Even better, Slider 3 is easily found with a little exploration.
				</p>
				<p>
					Solution: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						Move the tile you just got to the top right or bottom right corner of the grid. This will place it in the range of a light. The light will cause the fungi around the Slider to recede, allowing you to pick up the third Slider.
					</span>

				<summary class="header-2">Slider 4</summary>

				<p>
					My god, another light! The fungi surely stand no chance against your electrical might now…
				</p>
				<p>
					Hint: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						Remember the Slider trapped in the fungi on tile 1?
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					Solution: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						Place the first tile in the top-right corner, exposing it to light from the right. Place the third tile underneath the first tile, exposing it to light from the bottom. This will remove enough fungi for you to grab Slider 4 from the first tile.
					</span>
				</p>
			</details>
			
			<details>
				<summary class="header-2">Slider 5</summary>

				<p>
					On this tile is the cavern station. The power's gone out, and it's so dark that you can't even see the door!
				</p>
				<p>
					Solution: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						Move the tile with the light underneath slider 4. This will allow you to enter the station. Upon entering the station, talk to Chad and you will receive Slider 5.
					</span>
				</p>
			</details>
			
			<details>
				<summary class="header-2">Slider 6</summary>

				<p>
					Here you'll find another light, though the cable has been chewed up by rats. The Archeologist makes her triumphant return, but she seems to have lost yet another item! What a klutz!
				</p>
				<p>
					Hint: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						You'll need to use the light on this tile in order to reach the flashlight, which is located on the slider with the big bridge.
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					Solution Part 1: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						Pick up the key collectible from Slider 5, and return it to the worker on the left inside the cavern station. This will allow you to switch on power, powering the light on Slider 5 if it is to the left of the cavern station. You can also see the power line on the map, which lights up yellow once powered.
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					Solution Part 2: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						Find the tile with the flashlight (the second slider you got, with the river and large bridge), and place lights above and to the left. That will allow you to access the flashlight in the fungi patch. Return it to the archeologist and pick up Slider 6.
					</span>

			<details>
				<summary class="header-2">Slider 7</summary>

				<p>
					This tile is dominated by a massive field of fungi, with Slider 7 deep inside. You'll have to make full use of what you've learned so far to solve the puzzle, but it is possible! Make sure you've turned on the Station light too.
				</p>
				<p>
					Hint 1: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						This puzzle requires multiple moves, keep that in mind when setting up your grid.
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					Hint 2: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						There is no arrangement of tiles that will light up a full path from the outside of the fungus to the next slider.
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					Hint 3: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						You can move tiles around even while standing inside the fungus patch (assuming you're on a lit up space).
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					Solution: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						Place the power station light in the center of the grid, the other light tile in the top left, and Slider 6 in the top middle. Enter the fungi field, and stand in the row where there is no rock on the right side. Slide Slider 6 to the right, and then move the single light tile underneath Slider 6. You can then pick up Slider 7.

					What's this? A rat has stolen Slider 8, and is now running away! Time for your best Tom and Jerry impression. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Hint: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						The rat is faster, but you're smarter. Take advantage of the mechanics you've used so far, and your ability to move them.
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					Solution: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						You can either corner the rat to catch it or chase it onto some removed fungi and then take away the light to regrow it. Either way, you now have Slider 8.
					</span>

			<details>
				<summary class="header-2">Slider 9</summary>

				<p>
					The archeologist has already made a great discovery on tile 8, but she can't quite read the runes. Light up the entire map! It doesn’t matter if the tiles are in the “correct” spots, so long as they are all lit up.
				</p>
				<p>
					Hint 1: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						Try to avoid "double covering" tiles with multiple lights.
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					Hint 2: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						You'll want a light in the center of the map.
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					Hint 3: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						The other light should be in the top left or bottom left corner. Pay attention to where the walls are!
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					Solution: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						There are multiple configurations that work. If you want some direction to work towards, the "correct" tile configuration is also a valid solution (the missing tile will be in the bottom-left). If you've completed the final puzzle in Stonybrook Village, this will be a breeze. When the caves are lit, a short cutscene will play, and then you'll receive Slider 9.

						<span class="spoiler">
							The bottle moves once whenever you move any tiles, and sinks after two moves. This means you have to get it to Juliette in two moves.

							The solution involves the Anchor.
						</span>
					</p>
					<p>
						Solution:

							In order to move the bottle in two moves from the top-left to bottom-right, you need to make two diagonal moves. This can be done with the Anchor. If you put an anchor on the top-center or left-center tiles, you can rotate the tiles so that one of them makes a diagonal move. You can pick up the anchor and repeat the process to deliver the bottle with 2 diagonal moves.

				<summary class="header-2">How do Timed Gates Work?</summary>

				<p>
					This section is here to spell out how timed gates work, in case you have any confusion about them! Part of the fun is figuring them out and finding the edge cases you can exploit, but it's also spelled out here in case it gets frustrating.
				</p>
				<p>
					The goal of the timed gates is to power all of its inputs within a certain number of moves. You can see the inputs that you need to power as batteries near the gate, or also the LED indicators on the actual gate itself. If you can power all of them, then the gate will stay on forever.
				</p>
				<p>
					The large number on the gate represents how many tile moves you have left. If the gate has a 2 on it, then you only have two tile moves to power the entire gate. Conveyors do not count towards this limit!
				</p>
				<p>
					The moves are only counted once they <i>completely</i> finish though. This means that you can chain together conveyor belt moves in order to squeeze more out of the very last moves.

					The first slider is in a closet above the starting area.

					With the 4th tile, you are asked to gather several parts in order to 3D print the next Slider. They can be found in 3 different locations around the factory. After you get all 3 pieces you can use the 3D printer and it will make the next slider for you.
				</p>
				<p>
					Locations: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						The Base is on the same tile as the printer, the Walls are in the top-left of the Factory, and the Wires are in the bottom-right of the Factory.
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					Hint: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						One of the parts requires you to get a second item. You have the Anchor already, but you need to somehow free the Conductive Bob from the gated area in the top-right of the map so that you can use it.
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					Base Solution: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						In order to access the base, you need to power both lines to open both doors. To do this, you need two items, like the above hint mentions. You can free the Conductive Bob by using the Anchor to conduct the two pylons through the holes in the gate. The you can walk in and pick up the Conductive Bob, and then leave. After that, you can use the Anchor and the Bob to open both doors.
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					Walls Solution: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						The walls are behind the giant door in the top-left of the factory. You can power the timed gate near it using the tile with the printer.
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					Wires Solution: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						The wires are in the bottom-right of the Factory. Normally, the conveyor in the way will move tiles so you can't get there. However, if you jam three tiles in the bottom row of the grid, then the conveyor won't be able to push the tile and you can walk to the bottom of the Factory.

					Now, it's time to power the Mega Crystal! But, it needs 6 inputs? And it uses a 0 gate?!
				</p>
				<p>
					Hint 1: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						If you try and set it up so that all the inputs are powered at the same time, you'll quickly notice that you need some tiles to be in multiple positions at the same time. Which isn't possible!

					<span class="spoiler">
						The Mega Crystal needs to be in the center of the map.
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					Solution Part 1: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						In order to solve the puzzle, you need to set up a loop of conveyors so that they're always moving. That way, each of the inputs can be powered as the loop moves tiles around the Mega Crystal. 
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					Solution Part 2: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						First, use the conveyor override to make sure the conveyor belts aren't active. Then power all of the conveyor belts around the factory. Finally, before you re-enable them, make sure that the server room is powered so that the top two inputs can be powered during the loop, and make sure the Mega Crystal is in the center of the map. Turn on the conveyor loop and watch as everything gets powered! You'll need to stand on buttons or use the Anchor or Conductive Bob to weigh them down. Make sure to not power the magnets such that they stop the tile and the loop.
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					Solution Part 3: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						After the Crystal is powered, it will overload and cause a black out. You'll then have to use the crystal tile to power the server room and talk to Gene to run the server script. This will reset everything, but also send you to the past.

					With enough conductive bobs, Fezziwig the wizard is here to help us get back to the future.
				</p>
				<p>
					Hint 1: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						You have enough conductive bobs on the map to power the crystal. You can get one from Chad Sr., but he won't just hand it to you.

			<p>
				The Flats region has you fighting, commanding your Robot army to defeat the apathetic Aliens. You get as many tries as you want to win this rock-paper-scissors area.
			</p>
			<p>
				This area features a lot of randomness, so there is no explicit solution. However, we can try to give some tips.
			</p>
			<p>
				- Try to win as often as you can (or tie if you can't). The first few waves of aliens will always go the same, but then it's up to you to maximize your potential.
			</p>
			<p>
				- You don't have to use the supply reinforcements right away. Oftentimes it can be worth it to consider waiting until a better moment to create the troop.
			</p>
			<p>
				- There are six waves total, with an increasing number of enemies. Additionally you will get a reinforcement roughly for every other Slider you pick up.
			</p>
			<p>
				-The next wave will spawn once all the aliens in the current wave are defeated. Once there are 1-2 aliens left, try to rearrange the map and toops to prepare for the next wave.
			</p>
			<p>
				-Try to keep the map as open as possible. It's easier to escape a bad situation by sliding 2-3 tiles away vs moving a flag. Place sliders with walls near the edge of the map.

					By studying fossils from the Impact Zone, MRI scientists have created a super laser! In order to test it out, you'll need to explode a rock and retrieve some oil.
				</p>
				<p>
					Hint: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						Dropping the Anchor on a tile causes a desync -- it locks the tile in place, but enables you to move the tile in the other dimension.

					Head into the museum, and you'll find the Curator. He tells you a tale of two wizards who died in combat over a shield generator, which is now preserved in the museum. If things had ended differently, perhaps there would be some other remnant from the battle. Can you change history?
				</p>
				<p>
					Hint: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						To get access to the present shield generator, give one of the wizards the shield generator in the past.
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					Solution: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						On the past museum tile, move the pink shield generator to either one of the wizard's boxes. That wizard will win the duel, creating a gem which is preserved in the museum. Go to the present museum tile, grab the present shield generator from the upper floor of the museum, and bring it to the other wizard.

					On the new tile, there's a VERY hungry worker, who isn't satisfied with just one burger. It's become entangled with the very first burger ever created, which you'll need to steal.
				</p>
				<p>
					Hint 1: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						While you can bring present entangled items to the past, you can't bring past items to the present without the present version disappearing. That is, unless you could break the rules of time...
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					Hint 2: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						If either entangled item is on a desync tile, no pesky time continuity rules apply
					</span>
				</p>
				<p>
					Solution: 
					<span class="spoiler">
						Anchor the Hungry Worker's tile down, swap to the past and activate a desync by moving the past tile to a different location. The past burger should now have a lightning effect. Take the past burger and place it on the table next to the hungry worker. When both burgers are near the worker, he will give you Slider 6

					If you're still hungry for more challenges, each area has a bonus achievement. Most of these achievements require you to finish an area in a specific way, so you'll probably have to do it from a fresh save. Usually using cheats will disable these challenge achievements, but you can use the "Teleport to Area", "Spawn Anchor", and "Scroll + Boots" cheats to get to each of the areas for the achievement (*any cheat disables the speedrunning achievements on that save). There is also a one-hour speedrunning achievement that we think you'll enjoy a lot. Good luck figuring these out!				</p>
